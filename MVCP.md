How to measure the value and results of corporate philanthropy remains
one of corporate giving professionals’ greatest challenges. Social and
business benefits are often long-term or intangible, which make
systematic measurement complex. And yet: Corporate philanthropy faces
increasing pressures to show it is as strategic,cost-effective, and value-enhancing
as possible. The industry faces a critical need to assess current practices and
measurement trends, clarify the demands practitioners face for impact evidence,
and identify the most promising steps forward in order to make progress on these
challenges.

This report aims to meet that need, by providing the corporate
philanthropic community with a review of recent measurement studies, models,
and evidence drawn from complementary business disciplines as well as the social
sector. Rather than present an other compendium of narrative accounts and case
studies, we endeavor to generalize the most valuable concepts and to recognize
the strengths and limitations of various measurement approaches. In conjunction
with the annotated references that follow, the analysis herein should provide an
excellent starting point for companies wishing to adapt current methodologies in
the field to their own corporate giving programs.
To realize meaningful benefits, philanthropy cannot be treated as just
another "check in the box," but rather must be executed no less professionally,
proactively, and strategically than other core business activities. Our hope is
that this work will enlighten giving professionals, CEOs, and the investor
community to the many mechanisms by which philanthropic investments can
be measured and managed to achieve long-term business value and meet
critical societal needs.

# Introduction

Corporate philanthropy is as vital as ever to business and society but it
faces steep pressures to demonstrate that it is also cost effective
and aligned with corporate needs. Indeed many corporate giving
professionals cite measurement as their primary management challenge.
Social and business benefits are often long-term, intangible or both
and a systematic measurement of these results can be complex. Social
change takes time. The missions and intervention strategies involved
are diverse. For these reasons, the field of corporate philanthropy has
been unable to determine a shared definition or method of measurement
for social impact. Similarly, the financial value of enhancing
intangibles such as a company's reputational and human capital cannot
be measured directly and may not be converted into tangible bottom
line profits in the near term. Corporate givers and grant recipients
often useless formal anecdotal methods to convey impact. While stories
may vitalize and publicize a program's successes, it is more systematic
measurement that brings rigor and discipline to the field. Data-based
evidence quantifies the positive effects of corporate philanthropy
thus making a more persuasive case for why companies should engage in
philanthropic causes. If corporate philanthropy is to make progress in
meeting these challenges, the industry must meaningfully assess current
practices and measurement trends, clarify precisely what is needed in
terms of impact evidence and then identify the most promising and
practical steps forward. This report is designed to aid that critical
agenda. Interviews with senior corporate management and giving
professionals revealed a set of common questions they often face. These
questions fall naturally into a hierarchy of three conversations:

1. CONVERSATION ONE: Between grant recipients and their corporate funder's
Chief Giving Officer (CGO). The funder wants to know
- How to assess whether grantees are achieving the intended results and
- How to estimate a return on investment ROI numeric for comparing and or
aggregating the effectiveness across different grants in achieving
social results

2. CONVERSATION TWO: Between the CGO and Chief Executive
Officer (CEO).
- When pressing the CEO for significant commitment to
philanthropic programs the CGO is often asked to articulate a
business case and demonstrate how supporting the philanthropic
initiative will be valuable to business.

3. CONVERSATION THREE: Between the CEO and the investor community.
- Investors want assurance that spending
on corporate philanthropy enhances or at least does not diminish
shareholder value
- Concurrently a growing number of investors ask that
the companies in which they invest demonstrate greater philanthropic
leadership and social responsibility

Indeed investors increasingly
esteem companies that demonstrate strong social performance believing
that this represents management quality and valuable intangibles. The
ability to attract a large base of investors lowers costs of capital
and raises share price valuations which in turn should incentivize
companies to cultivate sustainable philanthropic programs that meet
society's critical needs. The question is: How?
Advanced by sophisticated
private foundations and governmental agencies, a wide range of impact
assessment methodologies already exists in the social sector. This
report examine show some of these methodologies maybe applied to the
specific needs and motivations of corporate giver's programs and
grants. A wide review of academic and industry literature on the link
between corporate social performance and financial performance
reinforces the idea that philanthropic initiatives create long-term
financial value by enhancing a company's employee engagement customer
loyalty reputational capital and market opportunities. But these
benefits accrue as intangible assets rather than as short-term cash
flows and thus are more complex to measure. Moreover the mechanisms
involved have not yet been well researched and understood. Consequently
some companies pay little attention to assessing philanthropy's
financial returns. Their engagement is primarily motivated by wanting
to meet community obligations and do the right thing. By analyzing
complementary disciplines such as human resources, marketing, risk
management and capital budgeting, corporate philanthropy
can improve its measurement methods and identify long term financial
benefits. The next three parts of this report present in greater detail
the conversations summarized above along with our analyses thereof.
The last section presents conclusions as well as recommendations for
how industry members might best proceed. An extensive glossary
references and annotated bibliography follow.


# CONVERSATION ONE: Between grant recipients and the Chief Giving Officer (CGO)

The nonprofit sector employs abroad range of frameworks tools
and methodologies to measure the social impact of programs and grants.
Many of these approaches have evolved through application by
sophisticated private foundations and government agencies, reflecting
these organizations own unique preferences priorities and social
values. Companies are encouraged to assess whether these approaches can
be applied to corporate giving programs. Corporate givers generally
demonstrate two types of philanthropic motivation. The first is a
response to community obligations and may characterize an employee or
community directed grant or volunteer program not necessarily aligned
with any strategic giving objective. The second motivation seeks to
define and differentiate the company through large visible signature
programs that tackle critical issues perhaps even on a global scale.
These programs typically involve the approval and engagement of senior
executives multi-year partnerships with nonprofit organizations and in
addition to cash, non-cash contributions such as in-kind products and
access to company expertise, training and connections. When evaluating
grant requests or designing signature programs corporate funders
seek to engage nonprofit partners in developing more systematic ways
to assess whether the intended results are being achieved and how
effectiveness across multiple grants can be aggregated and compared. 

Financial statements are expressed in common and
objective monetary units but social results are
much more varied, subjective and abstract. A review
of measurement methodologies did not turn up a silver bullet or single numeric and
learning from data against which performance can be and evidence over
time universally gauged. Rather this reading reinforced the notion that
to an extent measurement is its own reward. It encourages improvement
management and the explicit formulation of assumptions and
expectations. Measurement should be viewed as a process whereby the
greatest value is achieved through organizations building up and
learning from data and evidence overtime.

## Question 1: How to assess whether grantees are achieving intended results.

The most basic forms
of performance metrics comprise two categories: These are activities
such as the number of staff trained or amount of goods purchased and
outputs such as the number of clients served products distributed and
areas reached. With respect to giving programs comprising primarily
short term one-off grants driven by community obligations, simply
identifying activities and measuring output maybe all that is feasible.
However output and activity metrics alone cannot indicate that
positive societal changes are being achieved or if unintended harm is
being caused. In the case of program initiatives such as signature
projects companies share a strong connection with the cause and are
concerned about the social outcomes of their efforts. Managers of these
programs and their nonprofit partners must articulate the process by
which changes and results are expected to occur. They should outline
clearly how success is defined and track whether and how the programs
are affecting their beneficiaries. Jeffrey Brach, Thomas Tierney and
Nan Stone (2008) of The Bridgespan Group address how nonprofit
organizations can meet the mounting pressures they face from funders
to demonstrate the effectiveness of their programs. They
recount cases of several successful
nonprofits journey from aspirations to impact and suggest that
nonprofit and program leaders rigorously answer the following
interdependent questions

1. What are the results for which we will hold
ourselves accountable

2. How will we achieve them

3. What will they really cost

4. How do we build the organization we need to deliver
these results.

The classic article by John Sawhill and David
Williamson (2001) of The Nature Conservancy provides another
constructive account of the journey of a nonprofit organization toward
developing its model for assessing mission success. For decades, The
Nature Conservancy had measured advancement toward its goal conserving
biodiversity by protecting the land and water that rare species need
to survive by adding up the value of all charitable donations received
and land acreage acquired. These indicators, known as bucks and acres,
"enjoyed strong organizational support and quite frankly made us look
good" according to Sawhill and Williamson, but there lurked a nagging
question as to whether these input and output metrics represented
actual progress. The Conservancy decided then to develop a new
measurement system the centerpiece of which was a list of 98 leading
indicators of state program performance. However when the Conservancy
tried to implement a pilot test it collapsed under its own weight.
Field staff and managers complained about the laborious record keeping
and glut of information; moreover, they had no way of judging which
measures were most important and felt that the system was biased
against smaller resource poor programs. Lessons the Conservancy took
away from this experience include

1. Links among the mission programs and measures must be clearly
defined and articulated in order to narrow the number of required
indicators.

2. The measures should be easily collectible and communicable.

3. The measures should be strategically designed and applicable across
the organization at all levels while also encouraging of operating
units to focus on high level strategies.

4. Above all the measures must address progress toward
the mission and illustrate whether and how the organization's actions
make a difference.

The Conservancy settled
on two impact measures that it believed could serve as surrogates for
mission success: biodiversity health and threat abatement. The first was
straightforward and could be assessed through regular evaluation of
the organisms the Conservancy was trying to protect using existing
scientific surveys as a point of comparison/ The second measure, which
had to account for the inconsistent nature of biodiversity health and
threats, assessed the extent to which the Conservancy identified and
devised strategies to abate critical threats at each site. Grantees,
nonprofit partners and corporate philanthropic programs are more
likely to be successful if they address these questions at the outset.
Developing a theory of change and explaining how the program will
achieve its intended impact are critical components of this
preparatory work. To consider a specific example: The use of bed nets
helps reduce the transmission of malaria in endemic communities and
Figure 1 illustrates a theory of change often also called a logic
model for bed net distribution programs commonly applied in malaria
prevention work

for Malaria Prevention Source. Adapted from McLaughlin C Levy J Noonan

To further clarify the language of measurement
outcomes are those benefits or changes realized
as a direct result of a program's activities and
other outputs, while impact refers to long term
results and ultimate social value. Ideally one could measure along the
entire chain of results from initial activities through intermediate
outcomes to final impact and prove that the program directly resulted
in the changes observed. In practice, however, the rigorous evaluation of
impact is complicated twofold. First it often takes along time before
final impact can be observed and this involves a lengthy measurement
process. Second one must establish statistically validated causality
between services and observed impact in order to prove without doubt
that the program in question is responsible. To gauge a grant s success
corporate funders may use other assessment approaches that may be
less precise but more timely and practical. Ranked from most to least
precise common measurement approaches can be grouped into three
categories.

1. Formal impact evaluations: Commissioning formal program
studies is often the only way to measure and prove the impact arising
from a grant Many such impact studies are expensive and rigid
requiring significant data and a control group, i.e. of participants who
do not receive the program s treatments to be statistically reliable

2. Outcomes measurement systems: Measuring intermediate outcome metrics
maybe a practical alternative to formal impact evaluations. Monitoring
near term outcomes can identify opportunities for mid-stream
improvements. Applying the models and results of other already existing
studies can project impact. Definitive causation and attribution are
not formally proved but evidence from other similar treatments maybe
sufficient to establish that a reasonable link exists between the
measured outcomes and ultimate impact.

3. Assessment of the organization's impact achievement potential:
With respect to some grants corporate funders may choose not to
be involved in the design or management of
the program or measurement process relying instead entirely on the
grantee organization's own metrics data and standards.

In the social sector, evaluation experts have proposed standardized criteria for
assessing an organization's
potential for achieving measurable and improvable impact. Such
assessment can increase confidence among funders that a nonprofit is
effecting positive change according to its claims. High performing
characteristics include capable leadership, clear objectives, diligent
quality-data collection and analysis and the informed adjustment of
processes to improve.

Figure 2 Characteristics of Three Measurement Approaches.
Measurement Approach.  Formal Impact Evaluation. Outcomes Measurement.
Impact-Achievement Potential Assessment.

What outcome metrics are measured? Long-term impact as well as
intermediate outcomes. Intermediate outcomes. Outcome and/or output
metrics, which rely upon the grantee organization’s own theory of
change and measurement standards (funder assesses the organization’s
potential to achieve impact according to its claims).

How are outcome metrics designed and tracked? Draws from knowledge and
experience of third-party domain-area experts engaged to collect
(and/or supervise the collection of) data and then to conduct
evaluation analysis. The corporate funder Self-reported by grantee
participates in designing organization.  the program and its
measurement process, partnering with grantee organizations. Domain-
area experts may be consulted. Data is collected and analyzed in-
house by the grantee with the corporate partner’s technological and/or
management assistance.

How is impact measured? Long-term impact results are measured and
attributed. May be estimated by applying a model based on assumptions
or other evidence about the expected effectiveness of the
intervention. Estimates or actual measures of impact may be available
from grantee’s measurement process.

What serves as the counter- factual comparison?  (i.e., evidence of
what would occur if not for the program) Typically, a comparison group
is tracked, often using rigorous experimental design techniques such
as Randomized Control Trials (RCTs). Externally collected national or
regional datasets can be used to calculate comparison benchmarks with
similar characteristics as the target groups. Grantee organization’s
own research may provide comparable measures and demographics from
external publications to proxy as benchmarks.

To which programs should the approach be applied? 1. Reasonably mature
programs that represent an innovative solution and wherein the funder
and/or grantee seeks to prove to other funders or NGOs that it should
be scaled-up. 1. Programs wherein the funder is involved in the
program’s design and management and shares responsibility for its
success. 1. Start-up programs in their early stages of maturity and
stability.  2. Programs wherein the cost and risk of failure is high
(e.g., those with highly vulnerable beneficiaries).  9 2. Programs
wherein funders and grantees desire frequent and early indicators in
order to make real-time adjustments to interventions and strategy.
2. Programs wherein the funder is not involved in the program’s design
or management.


Choosing which approach or combination of
approaches to adopt depends partly on how much confidence funders
require in measurement precision and data quality.

- The rigor of formal evaluation places the greatest demand on the
quality of underlying data. It also requires the most time If grant
makers need to make timely decisions it maybe more practical to choose
and measure a proximate set of nearer term outcome indicators believed
to be predictors of ultimate impact.

- Programs that are not yet mature or stable may not be ready for
formal evaluation as their theory and implementation are still
evolving. In evaluations treatments cannot be changed without
invalidating the test while control group participants cannot receive
the program s services.

- Other evidence such as the social science literature may already
prove that similar types of interventions work well in certain
contexts. Regarding programs designed largely around evidence based
processes outcomes measurement and or impact potential assessment can
reasonably demonstrate that they are on track.

- Existing national and regional datasets can be
identified to construct reasonable comparison benchmarks in lieu of
formal control groups. For example, an extensive collection of regional
and worldwide statistics on the prevalence of obesity by age, gender,
ethnicity and other population characteristics already exists and
therefore can inform an assessment of programs addressing the obesity
issue.

- For programs wherein the corporate funder is actively involved
in design and management, it is worthwhile to implement outcomes
measurement systems, or conduct a formal impact evaluation study when
the program becomes more mature.

- If the risk and costs of failure are
high such as when beneficiaries are very vulnerable and the program
untested a formal evaluation may make sense to ensure the program is
not causing unintended harm.

- When a program is innovative and stable and the funder is seeking to attract
other funders or Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) in order to
replicate or expand it it maybe time to generate independent proof and
attribution as well as to measure the program s broader effects
through formal evaluation.

Figure 3 suggests a decision making map
whereby program managers may choose the best measurement approach for
them. Here the choice can be seen as depending on the motivation
forgiving and on the confidence needed in the precision of results and
quality of data.

Figure 3 Measurement Approaches and Motivation for
Grant.

### Impact evaluation

Formal impact evaluations seek to measure evaluation points along the
result chain and prove whether the program under review has been
effectual. Independent evaluators who possess domain and analytical
expertise are usually engaged as they bring unbiased knowledge and
credibility to the analysis. An evaluator designs the methodology
forgathering and analyzing data taking into consideration factors such
as sample sizes potential biases and how to establish a control group.
Once implemented, the program collects data until a sufficient sample
size has accumulated. Then sophisticated statistical tools analyze the
data for evidence of attribution. Finally an evaluation report is drawn
up and presented to stakeholders. The detailed quantitative analysis
contained there in is designed to satisfy a high burden of statistical
proof proof of positive impact in the treatment group and that is not
found in the control group.

Because formal evaluations employ the
highest level of precision and rigor as well as the engagement of a
credible external evaluator, they can be relatively lengthy, costly
and/or complex. Planning and budgeting in advance is imperative. At the
same time, formal evaluations are inherently retrospective, to an extent;
after all results cannot be reasonably anticipated until a program is
underway and often not confirmed until completion or long thereafter.
Evaluations can be disagreeably rigid in many situations because there
is little room if any for mid course methodology adjustment which
could invalidate the data already collected.

Formal evaluations remain a staple of the social sector when program
effectiveness must be demonstrated meticulously. Requiring program
stability and a high quality of data formal evaluations are more
suited to mature programs.  Funders and grantees should discuss at the
outset whether the evaluation's potential benefits will justify the
expenditure of resources involved. Programs that strategically and
innovatively address a social issue are good candidates for
independent evaluations, because the evaluation can prove attribution
and credibly demonstrate to additional funders or NGOs that the
programs are worth replicating or expanding. Also good candidates are
programs whose cost and risk of failure are high, such as when the
targeted beneficiaries are extremely vulnerable. In such cases
negative results that discourage continuing the program are of equal
or even greater informational value than positive ones.

### Outcomes measurement

Outcomes measurement approaches track
intermediate changes that are linked to ultimate impact. One example of
the social sector's progress with this approach is United Way of
America, which emphasizes the importance of outcomes and provides its
own local chapters with advice summarized in a guidebook entitled
"Measuring Program Outcomes: A Practical Approach and Focusing on
Outcome". Another approach has been jointly developed by The Urban
Institute and The Center for What Works (December 2006) to assist
nonprofit organizations in developing new outcomes monitoring
processes and or improving their existing systems. This approach
consists of a general framework for identifying common outcome
indicators and sector specific metrics applicable to fourteen program
areas. Although outcomes measurement encourages a focus on results, this
approach alone cannot declare definitively whether a program is
actually effecting change. Outcomes measurement may involve before and
after measurement techniques but not the randomized designs or control
groups needed as counterfactual comparisons for formal proofs. Still
whether the program is achieving its intended results can be
determined to an extent according to the following logic:

1. Existing national and regional datasets can serve as reasonable
comparison benchmarks.

2. Related evaluation studies or social science research
offer corroborating evidence.

3. There already exists a considerable
amount of confidence in the quality of the program's theory of change.

4. The measured data align with judgments suggested by close knowledge
of the grantee and interactions with the program s beneficiaries.

Outcomes measurement may generate information on a quarterly or more
frequent basis thus providing funders and grantees with almost real
time information about the project's progress. Used as part of
performance management, this approach allows grantees to make mid-
stream improvements to their intervention based on the latest data.
Often results are managed in a kind of dashboard, e.g. an array of
charts depicting the project's performance according to a variety of metrics over time
and relative to targets. Giving even more
structure to the process some performance
management systems integrate quality
control concepts already established by business management:
these include the company wide experience
"Balanced Scorecard" and "Six Sigma" in devising metrics principles.
Corporate givers are especially apt to assist
nonprofits in outcomes measurement because they
can draw on drawing appropriate company wide experience in devising
metrics, collecting data in a disciplined manner and drawing appropriate
conclusions to recommend action.

The specific logic model and performance metrics that should be
implemented in an outcomes measurement approach are best developed
jointly by the program's funder and grantees. The grantee
organization knows its own infrastructure and local conditions and
this knowledge is complemented by domain expertise and familiarity
with the broader social sector. For the benefit of certain causes and
strategies already well researched and evaluated NGOs research
organizations and funders have collaborated to endorse a set of
common core outcomes and impact metrics. Including the grantee in the
process of devising a measurement framework contributes to a greater
sense of partnership and leverages grantee domain expertise; sometimes
grantees even take the lead in defining data collection and
measurement design. Allowing the grantee this flexibility reduces the
burden of responding to different funders who ask frequently for the
same basic information. Moreover a partnership approach gives grantees
a greater sense of ownership and makes their decision makers more
likely to act on results. Throughout program implementation, the logic
model maybe re-examined and modified based on the latest data
available.  According to the W K Kellogg Foundation: "The process of
developing a model is an iterative one. ... Gaps in activities expected
outcomes and theoretical assumptions can be identified resulting in
changes being made." As Sonal Shah, director of the White House Office of
Social Innovation and Civic Participation, has said: "Just like business
which sometimes needs to course correct nonprofits and social business
should be able to course correct and
make changes. They should only be considered a failure if they fail to
correct the problem".

Outcomes measurement tracks the social changes a
program targets but the tracked metrics appear early along the results
chain. To estimate ultimate impact, one can apply a model drawn from
external evidence and adjusted to current local conditions pertaining
to ultimate effectiveness. This external evidence includes quantitative
data from prior studies and consultations with sector experts.

To expand on the earlier example of bed net distribution for malaria
prevention, Figure 4 outline show an estimate of impact results (e.g.
number of child lives saved can be calculated by tracking a key
outcome indicator). This indicator might be the additional number of
children that now use bednets. Evaluators then make informed
assumptions about the relevant demographics and anticipated
effectiveness of treatment based on prior observations and studies
adjusted for local conditions.

### Assessing impact achievement potential.

For grants in which the corporate funder is not
involved in program design or management the funder may choose to
rely on the grantees own measurement process standards and data. The
funder typically asks grant ees to self report regularly on the
following information:

1. What results they are committed to achieve;

2. What measurable evidence will be provided to verify success;

3. What baseline results will serve as a point of comparison for the new data; and

4. How the grantee will track results and adjust methodology mid-course.

When results are
self-reported, assessing impact achievement potential in a way that
also measures general organization capabilities can increase funders
confidence that the organization is achieving the outcomes it claims.
As an example of standardized ratings criteria for assessing impact
potential, the Alliance for Effective Social Investing has developed
and proposed the Outcome Potential Assessment framework. Their
framework assumes that regardless of what the nonprofit intends to
achieve there are certain organizational characteristics that tell an
investor whether the organization is likely to accomplish its goals.
For instance, if an organization does not have a theory of change, or
does not diligently collect quality data supporting its effectiveness,
or does not use the data it does collect to improve the organization
is unlikely to succeed. Using this framework, nonprofit organizations
are rated according to their diligence and acumen in collecting
interpreting and using data to improve services at the organizational
level. Comparisons should be confined to organizations working toward
comparable outcomes with similar
populations. Charity Navigator, the largest charity evaluator in the
country, is looking to adopt such an assessment framework so that
its final ratings will not just evaluate a charity's financial
performance but also take into account its potential to achieve
intended outcomes. High impact potential organizations must invest in
tools, training and operational resources needed for measurement.
Corporate funders may rely on grantees own measurement processes
but should also bear in mind that a quality measurement process is
vital to achieving impact value and should always be budgeted at the
source.

Methodology for the Alliance for Effective Social Investing's
Social Value Assessment Tool. To
determine an organization s capacity and potential to deliver high
social value, the Alliance for Effective Social Investing (2009) proposes
that analysts use a Social Value Assessment Tool which comprises 26
questions and scores organizations against six indicators:

1. Diligence in collecting data;

2. Possession of a clear set of outcomes and a logic
model that together describe how the organization intends to achieve
the desired outcomes;

3. Relation of efforts outputs to outcomes to
determine whether the organization's intervention is indeed producing
the observed outcomes;

4. Flexibility in adjusting the service approach
given the latest data and changing circumstances;

5. Substantiation of the
value of the program through data collection and analysis;

6. Capacity to
deliver program services as they were designed.

### Summary

Activities and output metrics and targets are the most
basic set of trackable performance measures/ In programs comprising
short-term, one-off grants, activities and output metrics might very
well be the only trackable measures. By themselves, however, output
metrics offer little indication that social change is being achieved
or unintended harm caused. The three measurement approaches outlined
above summarize options for assessing the success of programs where in
corporate givers are concerned about achieving social impact. Formal
evaluations (approach 1) are the only way to prove rigorously that an
impact is the result of an organization's efforts and therefore
validates a logic model. Outcomes measurement (approach 2) focuses on
nearer term changes that allow real-time adjustments to the
intervention strategy and logic model in place, and provide indications
that the program itself is causing the desired outcomes. Impact
achievement potential assessment (approach 3_ helps to determine whether
an organization has high-performing characteristics that will increase
the likelihood that self-reported outcomes are being deliberately
achieved. These three approaches are not necessarily exclusive; they can
be combined. For example a young program may still be evolving
strategically; its processes may not yet be stable enough to withstand
outcomes measurement or formal impact assessment. The organization's
potential for achieving impact should still be assessed, however, and as
the program matures, it may become worthwhile to develop processes by
which more precise measurement of actual impact may be applied as well.

## Question 2: How to measure the return on social investment
from grants and giving programs.

Return on investment (ROI) is a highly favored business concept. Given a
standardized ratio of financial benefits to costs, decision makers can
gauge how well a project is performing overall, compare the project's
efficiency to alternatives and even aggregate ROIs across multiple
projects.

There has also been enthusiasm particularly among
sophisticated private foundations for applying ROI techniques to
measure the social efficiency of philanthropic programs. In a study
commissioned by the Bill Melinda Gates Foundation, Melinda Tuan (2008)
performed a critical review of eight selected approaches for
integrating cost into the measurement of social value creation, and
noted that all of these different methodologies essentially reflected
one concept: expected return. Expected Return = (Outcome or Benefit) times
Probability of Success divided by Cost.

A major difference among methodologies is
whether benefits are monetized. Methodologies in which benefits are
monetized are classically described as cost-benefit analysis.
Methodologies in which benefits are not monetized are called cost-effectiveness
analysis. Measurement ratios based on cost-effectiveness
are easier to implement and require fewer data assumptions because
they sidestep the challenge of having to convert different aspects of
program benefits into common monetary units. However they can only
account for one area of program impact at a time since impact for
different program causes may be measured only in their programs'
respective natural units (e.g. lives saved as in the bednet/malaria
example).

As for comparing and aggregating impact across multiple grants:
A key challenge here is that diverse grants in dissimilar program
areas seek different outcomes. Corporate givers who choose to focus
high value grants to just one cause issue are likely to be able to
quantify impact in a common natural unit and achieve measurable impact
linked back to these grants. For programs such as these, cost-effectiveness
analysis is most appropriate. By contrast, cost-benefit
analyses assume that grant benefits can be monetized and therefore
the analysis is potentially applicable to aggregating the value of
grants applied to many different issues.
But cost-benefit analysis makes greater demands on data, funders'
assumptions and value judgments. Funders must collect the data needed
to estimate monetary benefits arising from the program and,
additionally, make many subjective judgments about the relative worth
of the different social outcomes achieved by different program types.
When corporate funders would prefer not to engage on this level (e.g.
because they do not have the expertise to collect and calculate the
necessary data or make the essential value judgments, or both) the only
practical alternative maybe to aggregate common output units such as
number of activities organized, products distributed or beneficiaries
served.

Figure 5 summarizes this decision framework for guiding the
choice of measurement approach. The choice of ROI analysis, if any, to
consider depends on the relative focus of the giving programs in
question as well as on the expertise of the funders to calculate and
use monetized benefits. The options themselves are discussed in more
detail below.

Figure 5. Approaches for Comparing and Aggregating Social
Impact Results Across Corporate Grants.

### Cost-effectiveness analysis.

Cost-effectiveness analysis features the calculation of a ratio of
costs (i.e. total contributions to the program) to a non-monetary benefit
or outcome. In other words it indicates a project's bang-for-the-buck.
Program impact is measured in natural units such as number of children
graduated or beneficiaries' life-years saved. This comparative analysis
requires programs to pursue the same domain
area and hence will be more applicable to corporate
giving programs that focus fewer high value grants on a single program
area. One cost-effectiveness approach to calculating ROI is that of the
Center for High Impact Philanthropy at the University of Pennsylvania
The Center has been developing its cost per impact methodology since
2006. The purpose of its analysis is to provide philanthropists with an
answer to the question: "How much does change cost?: The example below
features a project by the Children s Literacy Initiative (CLI) to train
pre-kindergarten through third-grade teachers in effective literacy
teaching techniques. 

Methodology for University of Pennsylvania Center
for High Impact Philanthropy's Cost per Impact.

- Step 1. Project future cost or take actual cost from previous
implementations. Example: Based on prior experience CLI estimated that
teachers would need three years of training to effect sufficient
change and lasting impact. The estimated cost to train twenty teachers
for three years is 1000000

- Step 2. Obtain empirical results from past implementations of the model
and use those to project the impact of current implementation. Example:
Based on national studies and prior experience, the Center and CLI
estimated an average kindergarten teacher's tenure to be fourteen
years. Since three of those years would be given over to training the
average teacher, tenure post-training would be eleven years (14 minus 3).
In an evaluation performed in White Plains NY, 49 of kindergarten
students met literacy benchmarks before the CLI training was provided
to teachers. Post training. the proportion increased 32 percentage
points to 81. Based on an average class size of 25, 25 x 20 teachers = 500
students who would be touched by the project each year. Given an
average teacher tenure of eleven years, 500 students per year x 11
years = 5,500 students touched. The incremental number of students
meeting benchmarks would then be 32% x 5,500 students = 1,760 students.

- Step 3. Divide cost obtained in Step 1 by results obtained in Step 2 to
produce cost per impact. Example: Dividing the cost of 1,000,000 by the
1 760 additional students meeting literacy benchmarks yields a cost
per incremental student or cost per impact of $568.18. As discussed one
advantage of quantification is that it allows comparison with other
projects. Hence a grantor could use the above cost per impact figure
to determine which grantee would provide the most bang for the buck.
Alternatively, a grantor could use this figure as a benchmarking tool
to identify effective trends and then work with his or her own grantee 
to improve their own ratio overtime. Source: Rhodes H J, Noonan K, 
Rosqueta K (December 2008).

### Cost-benefit analysis.

Cost-benefit analysis is advantageous in that it allows
comparison of the social value of diverse programs, much as one can
compare the financial ROIs of different companies. Benefits need not
come from the same cause and type of outcome but can capture a range
of individual and societal benefits across different program areas.
However two recent reviews by Melinda Tuan (2008) and Lynn Karoly (2008)
have noted that the methods for valuing cost benefits are not yet
mature or standardized. Attributing common dollar values to 
non-monetary results requires subjective value judgments. It is also
difficult to achieve consistency in assumptions or applied
methodologies such as (1) the timeframe over which benefits are
recognized, (2) the discount rate used to reflect the declining value of
money overtime periods distant in the future, (3) the methods used to
project future outcomes based on early outcomes, and (4) the range of
social benefits to be captured. Proponents of cost benefit concepts
like the Social Return on Investment (SROI) acknowledge these
challenges but also note that the very virtue of cost benefit analysis
lies in human assessors who are brutally open about such subjective
valuations and submit assumptions to sensitivity analysis and
intuitive assessment. This process can help clarify the extent to which
certain projections or judgments are overly optimistic or incomplete.
To consider an example, The Robin Hood Foundation has developed a
benefit-cost ratio methodology to capture collective benefit estimates
of its anti-poverty grants in four areas: jobs and economic security,
education, early childhood, and youth and survival. The benefit-cost
ratio seeks to translate the outcome of diverse programs into a single
monetized value. The example below features a grant to an
organization called Helpful Housing, which provides housing to the
economically disadvantaged. Since part of the project involves
providing supportive services such as medical care, mental health
counseling and employment training, the calculation also accounts for
those benefits. 

Methodology for Robin Hood Foundation Benefit-Cost Ratio.

- Step 1. Estimate the program s direct impact. The most direct and
tangible benefit provided by Helpful Housing is housing. Therefore to
calculate its value: Example: Based on data from the Federal Housing
and Urban Development Department, Robin Hood found the fair market
prices for New York City apartments to be approximately 11,700 per
year. Helpful Housing provided 672 housing units over the last yea.r
It is believed that the people served by Helpful Housing would have
remained homeless if Helpful Housing did not exist. Thus the full
market value of the housing provided would represent a net gain to
residents of 672 housing units times 11,700 average per year equals
0.78 million. Helpful Housing also provided housing only (i.e. without
supportive services) in the form of two bedroom apartments valued at
13,600 per year to 75 low-income families. Residents are required to
contribute only 30% ($2,400) of their annual income toward rent. Robin
Hood estimates that 10 of these families would have found housing
anyway even in the absence of Helpful Housing's assistance. So 75
families times (13,600 minus 2,400) times 0.9 (to account for those
families that found housing only as a result of Helpful Housing's
assistance) equals $760,000.

- Step 2 Estimate the additional impact of the program, i.e. benefits
from supportive services like medical care, mental healthcare,
employment training, etc. It is common for health improvements made by
health and human service projects to be expressed as Quality Adjusted
Life Years (QALYs) which measure the number of years of life added by
an intervention, adjusted for the quality of life in those additional
years. By definition, an extra year in perfect health would be
assigned a QALY value of 1 while an extra year added in less than
perfect health would be assigned a QALY value of between 0 and 1 based
on the extent of the disability. A commonly accepted guideline
proposed by Robin Hood and used here is to assume each QALY to be
worth $100,000.  Example: Referrals to Medical Care. Helpful Housing
provided medical referrals to 672 residents. However it is estimated
that 30 of those residents would have sought medical care
anyway. External consultants estimate that each medical referral is
worth a QALY of 0.07. 672 residents times 100,000 per QALY times 0.07
QALY times 0.7 (to account for the referral) times 0.7 (to account for
only those residents who would not have sought medical care were it
not for Helpful Housing) equals #2.3 million per year. Similar
methodologies were used to calculate other additional annual benefits
such as Mental HealthCare ($1.9 million), Employment Training
($800,000), Quality of Life Issues ($0.3 million), Case Management
($2.9 million), Reduced Hospitalizations and Medical Emergencies ($1.9
million).
 
- Step 3. Calculate lifetime impact and discount to present value. Where
the benefit is annual and occurs throughout the lifetime of the
individual, calculate the cumulative impact over the individual's
lifetime and discount to present value. Example: Robin Hood estimates
the average age of residents at Helpful Housing to be 40 years old and
calculates employment-related returns to age 55 and health-related
returns to age 65. It is assumed that the real growth rate is 3% and the
discount rate is 5%. Total Present Value = $31 million.

- Step 4. Estimate
the proportion of the program's successes truly attributable to Robin
Hood's grant, aka the Robin Hood factor. This calculation typically
begins with a figure based on the percentage of a grantee's program
cost covered by Robin Hood's grant. This approximate starting point is
adjusted up or down depending on other factors that lead Robin Hood to
believe the grant exerts disproportionate positive or negative
influence on group outcomes. Example: Robin Hood's grant was for $450,000.
the program cost $12 million in total. That yields a Robin Hood factor
of $450 000 divided by 12 million equals 4%.

= Step 5. Calculate the Robin Hood benefit. Sum
all benefits and scaleby the Robin Hood factor. Example: 31 million times 
4% equals $2.89 million.

- Step 6. Calculate the benefit cost ratio. Divide the Robin
Hood benefit by the cost of the program. Example: $2.89 million divided
by 450,000 equals 3:1.
Grantors may use this benefit cost ratio as one important
piece of information with which to rank grants (i.e. compare the impact
of similar and dissimilar programs) and as part of their diagnostic
toolkit with the goal of improving grantees' performance, thereby
raising the projects benefit-cost ratio overtime. However the ratio
should not be the only criterion for making grant decisions nor should
it be used as a report card.

Source: Weinstein M (2009) 

To translate
diverse outcomes into a single monetized measure of poverty fighting,
Robin Hood's program officers rely on social science research
estimates from academic consultants. close knowledge of their grantees
and an injection of reasonable assumptions. Over time, they expect
continually to improve their metrics and reduce guesswork. Additionally
Michael Weinstein (2009), Chief Program Officer of The Robin Hood
Foundation, described how the Foundation has addressed a number of
other implementation challenges. While benefit-cost ratios provide
Robin Hood with a systematic and transparent tool for comparing 
impact across different
program types on its mission, their adoption should not be undertaken
except by experts knowledgeable of its careful usage.

### Estimating leverage effects.

So far this report has discussed measuring the direct
social impact arising from a funder's contribution to a giving
program. A funder can also leverage its reputation and/or other 
non-monetary capabilities to support a program, thereby multiplying the
social impact achieved from both their and other funders' monetary
donations. These leveraging effects should be considered part of the
total merit of a grant or program:

1. Attracting other funders. A funder seen to have expertise in a
certain domain could highlight the severity of a social cause by
endorsing it and attracting other funders to the same cause. For
example, a major pharmaceutical company with a reputation for
innovative research might become the first to make significant
philanthropic commitments to, and educate other funders about the
AIDS pandemic in Africa. Evaluating the results achieved by pilot
strategies also helps to communicate the credibility and viability of
these programs and draw additional support.

2. Capacity building. Grantors can also create social value indirectly 
by improving the performance of high potential granees, maybe by 
building their operational or leadership structures.
Companies can multiply the positive
effects by contributing internal expertise
technological assistance and access to
training opportunities and other non-cash
relationships. For example, enhancing performance measurement
systems provides practical real-time data that supports learning and
allows nonprofits to adjust their services efficiently, thereby
maximizing the impact of not just one particular project but of
projects across the entire organization.

Leading users of ROI
methodologies consider such leverage effects in their calculations. The
Hewlett Foundation estimates the portion of success with which 
the Foundation could be credited based on a
combination of dollar amount invested and the influence of those
dollars. The Robin Hood Foundation also estimates similar measures (the
Robin Hood factor) as the proportion of program success truly
attributable to the giver's intervention. This figure is often based in
part, but only in part, on the ratio of the grant to the grantee's
total program cost. 

Estimating credit for leverage effects requires a
combination of subjective judgments and quantitative data. One approach
is to reduce this analysis to that of assessing the most likely
alternative scenario had the catalytic funder not intervened. Once all
subjective and observational inputs have contributed to this
hypothetical scenario, the subsequent calculation of leverage effect
is straightforward. 

Suppose a corporate funder provides a catalytic
gift of 2 million towards a health program. The gift raises the program's
profile and attracts another 3 million in gifts from other funders
for a total budget of 5 million. This number generates an impact
equivalent to 100 QALYs. The corporate funder through consultations
with the grantee and members of the social sector believes that
without its gift only 2 million (2/5 th's of the actual amount) would
have been raised. In this scenario, only 40% or 2/5 th's of the actual
100 QALYs would have been achieved. Therefore the total impact for
which the funder could take credit is the difference 100 - 40 = 60 QALYs.
This number, 60, comprises 40 QALYs from direct funding in proportion
to the 2 million grant being 2/5 th's of the total budget and a
balance of 20 QALYs credited to the leverage effect.

Consider another
example: Suppose a health program with a total budget of 5 million from
other funders (i.e. excluding the funder whose leverage is to be
measured) delivers 100 QALYs in program impact. Now, the leveraging
funder can make a capacity-building grant of 1 million which increases
the program's effectiveness such that its impact rises to 150 QALYs.
The leveraging funder also estimates, based on consultation with the
grantee and other social sector experts, that there would have been
only an 80% chance of another capable funder stepping in with a
similarly effective capacity building investment. Thus the most likely
and beneficial alternative scenario is 80% x 150 + (100% - 80%) x 100 = 140 
QALYs. The leveraging funder's capacity building grant can therefore be
viewed as achieving 10 QA LYs in leverage effects, in addition to 23.3
QALYs of direct proportionate impact, because 1 million represents 1/6
th's of the total program cost which delivered 140 total QALYs in the
best likely alternative.

### Summary 

The attractiveness of these ROI methods for calculating
corporate philanthropy's social returns is in bringing businesslike
quantitative frameworks to evaluating and comparing the effectiveness
of diverse social programs, and aggregating their social impact. However
these sophisticated methodologies place heavy demands on data
collection assumptions and value judgments underlying the analysis. 
Funders must assemble data and calculations on the program's monetary
benefits and make subjective judgments on the relative value of
different types of social changes. Corporate funders need to be
knowledgeable and thoughtful about these limitations and typically
should not rely solely on ROI when evaluating grants. Proponents of
these methods note that the benefits of ROI analysis lie more in
encouraging funders to lay bare the assumptions and trade-offs that
may already be involved in their grant making decisions. 

Corporate funders who focus their giving on a small number of program
areas can define and measure impact using the same natural unit. These
results can be analyzed more easily with cost-effectiveness
approaches, which sidestep the larger uncertainties associated with
cost-benefit analysis and reducing benefits across different program
areas to a common monetary unit. 

Some ROI models also seek to take into account the leverage benefits
the funder may generate if its grant has a catalytic or capacity
building effect. Corporate givers are increasingly committing to
capacity building initiatives recognizing that the internal expertise
training opportunities product and other company resources generate
benefits beyond cash grants. Estimating leverage value inevitably
requires subjective input. One method for improving a value estimation
of leverage is to try to assess and judge what would have resulted
from the best likely alternative scenario.

For example, The Foundation Center and
McKinsey Company have undertaken a project an online database of Tools
and Resources for Assessing Social Impact (TRASI) identifying 150
different approaches currently used to measure the social impact of
programs. 


# CONVERSATION TWO. Between the Chief Giving Officer (CGO) and 
Chief Executive Officer (CEO).

According to research by McKinsey and CECP (2008), 86 of surveyed CEOs
consider both business and social concerns when funding corporate
philanthropy programs, and 55 believe business concerns should be
given equal or greater weight than social ones. When advocating
significant commitments to philanthropic initiatives, CGOs are often
asked to make a business case for those initiatives, to present a
persuasive picture of how they create long-term financial value for
their companies in addition to using the social impact assessment
frameworks described above to communicate societal accomplishments

## Question 3. How to measure business benefits and make a business case.

CEOs surveyed by
McKinsey and CECP (2008) cited frequently that corporate philanthropy's
business goal should be enhancing the company's reputation or brand,
followed by addressing employee concerns such as refining leadership
capabilities and building retention and recruitment. The study also
reported that efficient philanthropists, defined as respondents who
felt their companies were effective in achieving both business and
social goals, tended more than other respondents to view the goal of
their philanthropic programs as creating business innovation and
building new market knowledge.

These findings, combined with a review
of the scholarly literature, suggest four strategic pathways by
which philanthropic initiatives can contribute to business value:

1. Enhance employee engagement. Companies engage employees through group
volunteer programs and awareness of their philanthropic initiatives
which raise employee motivation productivity and a sense of
identification with the organization.

2. Build customer loyalty.
Especially in consumer oriented industries, a company's commitment to
communities and certain philanthropic causes enhances brand perception
customer loyalty repeat business and word of mouth promotion.

3. Manage downside risks to the company's reputation.
Philanthropic initiatives
provide companies with a fresh opportunity to prioritize and address
stakeholder risks (i.e. ways in which the company may not be meeting
public expectations)

4. Contribute to business innovation and growth
opportunities. Philanthropy also provides access to new relationships
and opportunities, whereby the company can find test and demonstrate
new ideas technologies and products.

### Employee engagement

Today's competitive business environment emphasizes quality and innovation.
Accordingly CEOs recognize that human capital is a more critical asset
than physical capital in creating substantial value for the firm and
its shareholders. A highly engaged workforce is more likely to exert
extra effort and have lower turnover rates. Some studies even show a
link between individual employee motivation and company wide financial
performance. Compensation is a motivator only up to a point, beyond
which employees are motivated by non-pecuniary factors like 
self-esteem and recognition. The accepted wisdom seems to be that a paycheck
may keep someone on the job physically but not emotionally.
Psychological studies have shown that calling attention to
extrinsic (especially monetary) rationales for behavior can diminish
performance and intrinsic motivation. Perceiving that they had to be
externally and financially induced to carry out a task, employees come
to believe that there must not have been any other motivation for
performing it. This finding highlights the 
importance for companies to focus not merely
on monetary and other extrinsic rewards alone.

Economists have documented that companies with motivated employees,
a category that
overlaps considerably with Fortune Magazine's 100 Best Companies to
Work for in America, enjoy better financial performance. The Best
Companies list was first published in a book by Levering, Koskowitz
and Katz in March 1984 and was updated in February 1993. Beginning in
1998, it has been featured in Fortune each January. Two-thirds of the
total score comes from employee responses to an anonymous 57 question
survey created by the Great Place to Work Institute in San Francisco.
The survey provides an extensive evaluation of the level of trust
employees have in their management, the level of pride in their work
and company, and camaraderie within the workplace. The remaining one
third of the score comes from the Institute's evaluation of factors
such as a company's demographic make up, pay and benefits packages. 
Olubunmi Faleye and Emery Trahan (2006), researchers from Northeastern
University, examined several dimensions of operating performance and,
even after controlling for prior financial performance in their
econometric analyses, they found measures of valuation profitability
and productivity for the Best Companies to be about 15-20% higher than
for the Best Companies' peers. Separately Alex Edmans (2008), a professor
of finance at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, found
that on average, the Best Companies achieved higher than expected
future profits, particularly for earnings far into the future. A
portfolio of Best Companies stocks based on only prior released
rankings and rebalanced annually outperformed other similar companies
by 4% per year over a 22-year period from 1984 through 2005. Edmans
suggested that, because the results of an intangible investment like a
motivated workforce may not completely manifest intangible benefits
for several years, the market appears not yet to have fully accounted
for the link between employee satisfaction and company value. 

To raise
employees' internal motivation, HR managers endeavor to improve those
employees sense of status, prestige, belonging within the work group and
organization, and emotional rewards inherent in their work. A number of
studies have found that corporate philanthropic initiatives can
provide a new channel for fulfilling a number of
employees' emotional needs and increasing their sense of identification
with a company. These initiatives can also help employee recruitment.
According to the 2004 corporate community involvement survey by 
Deloitte LLP, 72% of employed Americans trying to decide between two jobs
offering the same location job description pay and benefits would
choose to work for the company that also supports charitable causes.
Although it is not easy to validate answers to a hypothetical question,
companies are often able to document their success in attracting
certain top candidates based on those candidates exposure to the
company s philanthropic causes and therefore can claim some legitimate
credit for the philanthropy's role in successful recruitment. 

A model for measuring the influence of corporate philanthropic initiatives on
employee engagement.

When devising philanthropic activities for
employees researchers from management and social science disciplines
suggest that the key objective companies should target and measure is
an increase in an employee's sense of organizational identification
Identification is a psychological concept that in this context
reflects the extent to which employees feel that their sense of self
overlaps with that of their employer An anecdotal measure of
identification is the use of we statements by employees who identify
strongly with their company i e who have internalized the distinction
between we insiders and people outside CB Bhattacharya, Sankar Sen
and Daniel Korschun (2008), researchers from Boston University and
Baruch College, found that employees who identify strongly with their
company view its success as their own and exhibit higher performing
job behaviors to ensure that success. Caroline Bartel (2001) from New
York University and David Jones (2007) from the University of Vermont
reported field evaluations whereby they measured both attitudinal
and work behavior changes of employees who participated in the
irrespective company s community outreach programs Their research
supported the finding that employees involved in philanthropic
initiatives showed a statistically significant increase in their sense
of identification with the irrespective companies This improvement in
employee attitudes towards their companies was in turn correlated to
an improvement in job performance.
 
Through awareness of and participation in their employer s
philanthropic activities employees can also fulfill several
fundamental emotional needs The studies noted that the range of
emotional needs is quite diverse and companies often do not understand
them well 

1. Collective self esteem Employees want to feel positive
about their company and want others to view the company positively as
well 

2. Self development Employees can use philanthropic opportunities
both to express a personal sense of community responsibility and to
learn specific career advancement skills Several major pharmaceuticals
and companies in other industries for example maintain programs 16 in
which top professionals apply their skill sets to work with external
nonprofit partners sometimes in remote foreign locations and this
experience hones those skill sets Pfizer 17 has made available an
evaluation of the impact of its Global Health Fellows Program on
recipient organizations along with a toolkit that other companies can
use to measure their own international corporate volunteering programs

3. Improving work and personal life integration Employees interpret
employers philanthropic behavior as an indication that the employer
values personal life as much as the employee does particularly when
the philanthropy benefits the employee s own social communities.

4. Building a bridge to the company Employees who work in satellite
locations view philanthropic initiatives as a means for the company to
demonstrate a bond among employees regardless of location This is
especially important as work forces become increasingly globally
dispersed 

5. Creating a reputation shield Corporate philanthropy can
help employees combat negative public feedback about a company by
giving them material with which to educate external audiences about
the company score values and efforts To measure the impact of
corporate philanthropy on employee engagement companies can use
internal surveys to assess the extent to which the philanthropic
program is meeting employee needs and creating a greater sense of
identity between employee and employer This assessment should take
into account the relative importance that different employee segments
attach to different intrinsic needs.

Drawing from
the research studies reviewed Figure 6 summarizes the causal
relationships between employees emotional needs and job related
outcomes Companies able to understand the needs and attitudes of their
employees and to design programs that fulfill those needs are often
rewarded with greater employee identification and a multitude of other
pro company outcomes Figure 6 A Framework for Measuring Employee
Engagement and Corporate Philanthropy Source Adapted from Bhatt
acharya C B Sen S Kor s chun D 2008 and Bart el C 2001 Positive job
related behaviors include objective metrics such as reduced
absenteeism lower employee turnover and greater efficiency More
subjective outcomes generally assessed in performance reviews include
enhanced work effort (i.e. greater dedication to excellence and a
willingness to expend extra energy), advocacy (i.e. a greater tendency to
make suggestions for improvements and innovation) and co-operative
conduct.

estimate a statistical regression model of how much employees
organizational identification correlated to productivity value The

employee survey results to HR data such as performance reviews and
productivity metrics Relative employee performance rankings efficiency
attendance retention and other employee attributes then must be
translated to relative dollar values 18 To improve the model s
statistical validity and to justify this performance proxy other
control variables must be accounted for such as job definition

managers have long recognized that securing customer loyalty is a
valuable goal partly because retaining customers tends to require
fewer marketing resources than recruiting new ones Moreover customer
loyalty consistently shows high correlation to sales growth and
profitability Loyal customers demonstrate several pro company
behaviors they tend tore purchase the company s product or service
commit a higher share of their category spending to the company and
are more likely to recommend the company or brand to new customers 20
Traditional marketing strategies often focus on customer loyalty
scores and on improving loyalty by enhancing customers perceptions of
the product s quality and value The perception of a company s values
through its philanthropic programs also matters of course All else
being equal a consumer is more likely to choose a product made by a
highly responsible company than one made by a less responsible one
Geoffrey Heal 2008 of Columbia Business School recounted the customer
research experience of a consumer goods company The company had built
a customer loyalty model based on a composite of its customers
responses to seven survey instruments whether they 1 ask for the brand
2 re purchase the same brand 3 recommend the brand 4 use other
products by the same brand 5 overrule a salesperson pushing another
brand 6 will only buy the brand and or 7 switch stores for the brand
Passionately loyal customers are defined as those who answer
affirmatively to atleast four of those seven questions The company
estimated that a one percentage point increase in their brand s
Customer Loyalty Index CLI the percentage of all customers who are
passionately loyal translated into a nearly 5 increase in sales
Furthermore the company s research revealed that its customers
emotional motivations were twice as important as product
considerations in driving brand loyalty Out of about fifty touch
points tested social responsibility was among the top five important
factors to consumers in terms of loyalty Accordingly the company
learned that it could increase its emotional connection with consumers
by tying its brand to the company s commitment to a social cause.

A model for measuring the influence
of corporate philanthropy initiatives on customer loyalty Customer
loyalty scores are typically measured by surveys that ask consumers to
rank their intention store purchase or recommend a product according
to a numerical scale Measuring customer intentions rather than actual
purchasing behaviors provides companies with a more timely and
operable loyalty assessment Researchers may implement different
proxies however ranging from a composite survey that measures multiple
customer intentions to a single best metric like the Net Promoter
Score 21 which is based on customers intention tore purchase Companies
periodically validate intentions by following upon customers actual
behaviors This more involved validation exercise also allows the
company to calibrate how much sales growth can be expected as a result
of increased loyalty Because marketing managers have a company's
traditionally focused on product or service philanthropic involvement
performance as drivers for customer loyalty can lead customers to the
attention has long been on customer feel a deeper sense of
satisfaction and trust in the brand But identification with the
customer awareness of a company s company and develop a philanthropic
efforts is an additional more positive evaluation channel by which
loyalty can be achieved of the company s Presenting the findings of a
telephone abilities survey conducted among a national sample of 1033
adults the 2004 Cone Corporate Citizenship Study reported that eight
in ten Americans agree that corporate support of a cause wins their
trust Moreover 86 said that if the quality and price of a product are
equal they would be likely to switch brands in order to help support a
cause Field research studies have shown that a company s philanthropic
involvement can lead customers to feel a deeper sense of
identification with the company and develop a more positive evaluation
of the company s abilities and that this results in product purchases
However these studies have also found and emphasized that the pathway
from customer awareness of corporate philanthropy to loyalty is less
straightforward than hypothetical marketplace polls and surveys
suggest Victoria Smith and Peter Langford 2009 from Macquarie
University in Australia and CB Bhattacharya and
Sankar Sen (2004) from Boston University and Baruch College document
that customers perceptions and expectations can be complex when
confronted with a company s corporate philanthropic record and suggest
that this affects how much philanthropic initiatives actually do
translate into increased loyalty and purchases Consumers lack of
awareness about philanthropic initiatives is often a major limiting
factor in their ability to respond At the sametime disingenuous
attempts by the company to sell philanthropy can backfire
Philanthropic initiatives are more likely to lead to positive customer
behaviors when the cause is perceived to fit well within a company s
overall strategy Consumers view companies that base their business
strategies around socially responsible principles more positively than
companies that attempt social responsibility as an add on action
Consumers maybe skeptical when a company with a negative reputation
becomes involved in causes closely related to its business Different
personality traits result in different responses to corporate
philanthropy efforts what works for one consumer segment may not work
for another Individuals who personally support the issue central to
the company s initiatives are more likely to be persuaded to purchase
its products Companies perceived to have distinguished themselves on a
corporate responsibility platform generally enjoy a loyal following
among a certain segment of customers Consumers generally do not like
to be asked to pay a premium for philanthropy nor do they want to
sacrifice product quality Perception of a company s capabilities in
other areas also modifies how consumers respond to philanthropy
Researchers have identified a strong statistical relationship between
consumer satisfaction and companies philanthropic record only when
companies are perceived to have strong product quality and innovation
capabilities and or operate in consumer oriented industries 22
Designing a measurement framework for loyalty should begin with an
assessment of the perceptions customers have already developed as a
result of a company s corporate philanthropic initiatives and whether
these perceptions are
contributing to higher loyalty scores Figure 9 suggests such a
framework based on the literature reviewed Figure 9 A Framework for
Measuring Customer Loyalty and Corporate Philanthropy Source Adapted
from Bhatt acharya C B Sen S 2004 and Smith V Langford P 2009 A
company s marketing department is likely already to have implemented
its own customer loyalty metrics in which case it is sensible to
leverage these along with customized deliberate customer research It
is imperative that the additional factors affecting loyalty scores e g
customer perceptions of product quality and value also betaken into
account Figure 10 proposes representative survey instruments that
companies may adapt.

reputation is invaluable to a company How external stakeholders see a
company as good rather than bad reinforces the company with better
human capital goodwill legitimacy and a license to operate in the
communities it serves and seeks to enter However as Benjamin Franklin
once said it takes many good deeds to build a good reputation and only
one bad one to lose it Managing downside reputation al risk before a
crisis strikes is critical much less can be done after the crisis has
occurred Researchers have documented how a record of community based
initiatives creates goodwill that can mitigate stake holder sanctions
ranging from mild e g casual bad mouthing to severe having one s right
to do business revoked when negative events arise Paul Godfrey Craig
Merrill and Jared Hansen 2009 of Brigham Young University point out
that the severity of such sanctions may depend on both the negative
effects of the action and the perceived intentions of the offending
company In other words punishments are more severe when bad acts are
committed by bad actors Moreover long accumulated goodwill trust and
familiarity can moderate the negative reputation al effect of a
company blunder as these traits often encourage stakeholders to
attribute the negative event to a singular managerial mistake rather
than an intentional course To test this idea Godfrey Merrill and
Hansen collected and examined stock price reactions for a large sample
of companies that experienced negative legal or regulatory actions
Such negative events to the extent that they are unanticipated or
partially anticipated should generate negative stock price reactions 
as investors expect negative long accumulated
stake holder reactions However goodwill trust and commitment to
community initiatives could familiarity can moderate serve as a signal
to investors of the goodwill the negative reputation al and positive
perception of management effect of a company character enjoyed by the
company and blunder which may temper possible sanctions The
researchers examined 160 companies that appeared from 1991 to 2002 in
a data set maintained by the research firm KL D Analytics The data set
contains analysts assessments of the companies social participation in
community and diversity initiatives The researchers also reviewed Wall
Street Journal articles published between 1992 and 2003 looking for
negative events such as the initiation of a lawsuit against any of the
companies by a customer third party or competitor or the announcement
of regulatory action e g investigation fines penalties etc by a
government entity The announcement events were grouped into either
integrity based actions such as discrimination claims fraud
accusations false claims dishonesty pension or investor obligation
claims or bribery allegation and competitive or health safety actions
including competition conspiracy anti trust claims patent
infringements price fixing accusations consumer medical injury issues
product safety problems quality control issues and environmental
pollution indiscretions The researchers reported that companies
participating in social initiatives preserved greater share value
adjusted for market wide price movement around these negative
announcements than those who did not participate in social initiatives
However the data does not reveal the relative severity of the negative
events hence the study was unable to control for the possibility that
the missteps done by good companies simply were not as bad as those
done by the companies less socially engaged The value effects were
strongest surrounding those events categorized as integrity related In
a back of the envelope calculation the researchers estimated that
companies not engaging in social initiatives lost on average 72 4
million per negative event while socially engaged companies lost only
22 8 million relative to the average market capitalization of 32 6
billion for all companies on the days preceding the events.

A model for measuring the value of
corporate philanthropy in terms of managing reputation al risk Many
companies already have in place a strategy for managing reputation al
risk This strategy typically includes identifying events that may lead
to reputation al damage assessing the likelihood and severity of
damage and preparing plans to manage these risks 24 The first step in
assessing these risks is to identify key stakeholders internal and
external such as customers suppliers and regulators understand their
expectations vis vis the company s current reputation and develop a
master list of risk events A starting point for identifying reputation
al threats is a list of stake holder groups and their corresponding
threats as analyzed by Charles Fo mb run Naomi Gard berg and Michael
Barnett 2000 of New York University and summarized in Figure 12 To
quantify stake holder expectations and reputation al risks a company s
Enterprise Risk Management or Public Relations department may conduct
a reputation assessment often applying one or more of the following
techniques 1 analysis of media hits and stories 2 interviews with
front line employees 3 consultations with stakeholders and industry
executives 4 focus groups and 5 public opinion polls 25 Precise
valuation of reputation al insurance against these threats is
difficult When litigation community protests and other crises are
successfully avoided costs will never be recorded and the resulting
impact on profits or share prices goes unobserved However these costs
can be real and significant Scenario analysis is a tool commonly used
in addressing such problems and estimating the potential cost of these
risks Each potential event needs to be assessed in terms of the
likelihood that it will occur and the severity of the potential
reputation al damage as suggested in Figure 13 Companies can perform a
quantitative assessment of the impact of reputation al damage in terms
of reduced operating revenue or increased compliance operating or
capital costs This may involve simulation techniques to map out
numerous scenarios and estimate average frequency and loss severity
The company can then prioritize these risks and decide whether and how
they can be eliminated reduced or accepted.

Positioning
corporate philanthropy either internally or externally is not
straightforward Companies need to be wary that stakeholders might
cynically perceive these initiatives as just empty claims or public
relation devices Corporate philanthropy needs to represent and be
embedded in a natural extension of the company s values and operations
NGOs and nonprofit partners who speak on companies behalf bring more
credibility At the sametime the bigger a company s reputation and the
larger the gap between perception and reality the more vulnerable the
company is to reputation al attacks Innovation and growth
opportunities Innovation which is key to sustaining a competitive
business advantage often emerges from creative problem solving Rosa
beth Moss Kant er 1999 of Harvard Business School has suggested that
companies can view community need as a business opportunity to develop
ideas demonstrate technologies find and serve new markets and solve
longstanding social problems Companies can further their capabilities
by applying their best people and core skills to advancement that
benefits both business and community Kant er even goes s of aras to
suggest thinking about these efforts not simply as charity but as a
strategic business investment Jane Nelson and Beth Jenkins 2006 of
Harvard University reviewed several examples of companies looking to
their philanthropic community investment and employee volunteering
programs as sources of innovation for the company its partners and the
communities and countries in which it operates Sarah Holmes and Lance
Noir 2007 access to a diverse from Cranfield University in the U K

becomes increasingly collaborative relationships with nonprofit
valuable to companies organizations As drivers of innovation wishing
to generate disperse beyond traditional company and be associated with
boundaries access to a diverse range of new ideas external partners
becomes increasingly valuable to companies wishing to generate and be
associated with new ideas Nonprofits offer companies access to a dense
network distinct from the companies own corporate sphere as well as
afresh view of the modern marketplace NGOs for example lead social
movements and can give early warning about shifts
in public tastes and values. They may also possess unique technical
expertise and influence on public legislation resources that corporate
partners are likely to find advantageous when exploring new markets As
suggested by a Boston College Center for Corporate Citizenship and
McKinsey Company 2009 review of practices among twenty companies
philanthropic activities could have a demonstrable impact on corporate
growth through several pathways New markets Philanthropic activities
expose companies to new markets and increase market share through
exposure New products Philanthropic activities can involve the
creation of products that meet social needs and increase
differentiation New customers Philanthropic activities engage new and
existing consumers and contribute to a greater understanding of
consumer expectations and behavior New technologies Philanthropic
activities can lead to the development of cutting edge technologies
and innovative products also applicable to business use patenting and
proprietary knowledge The financial impact arising from these
philanthropic activities ranges from profits increased directly
through sales or indirectly through goodwill or savings related to
risk avoidance or operating efficiency gains Models for measuring the
value of corporate philanthropy in terms of innovation and growth
opportunities There are three standard financial valuation methods
that can be applied to measure the value of corporate philanthropy as
an opportunity for business innovation and growth I Market based model
The market based approach is the most straightforward It relies
however on being able either to observe a market price for the project
in question or comparisons to the market values of other similar
projects or assets For example innovation may result in a new patent
which has a market price when put up for sale to other companies

Another example if other similar businesses already
have a market price then the project can be
valued by applying the same financial multiples e g price to book
value or price to earnings ratios of those comparable s II Cash flow
model The income or cash flow based approach is often used instead of
the market based model because market prices are not readily available
particularly for unique projects or projects that cannot easily be
isolated and assessed as stand alone entities All future cash flows
are estimated and then discounted to arrive at their net present value
The three steps comprising the cash flow based approach are 1 Estimate
future cash flows including revenues and expenses This captures the
enhanced revenues or savings the innovation has effected 2 Determine
the time period over which these cash flows are earned 3 Apply an
appropriate discount rate which reflects the time value of money and
the relative risk or uncertainty of cash flows III Real options
analysis model Innovations can also provide companies with the
potential to create cash flows that will exist in the future but do
not exist now For example a company may develop a new commercial
technology as a residual benefit from sustained efforts tackling a
social sector objective This technology may not be financially viable
today which is why the company does not commercialize it and does not
enjoy any current cash flow owing to its existence Nevertheless the
technology may have considerable value to the company because it can
be developed in the future Financial scholars including A swath
Damodar an 2006 have noted that such examples of intangible assets
maybe undervalued on a traditional cash flow basis and are best valued
using the real options approach Charles Fo mb run and his co
researchers 2000 have also suggested that were firms to view
citizenship through the real options lens they might overcome these
myopic tendencies to under invest in it To illustrate the valuation
concepts underlying the real options approach consider a hypothetical
example of a company gaining access to a newmarket 26 through exposure
from its philanthropic programs. Small medium sized enterprises S MEs
in an emerging market country can form a sizable customer base for their 
products. However start up costs for a
business venture are substantial and business revenues though
potentially large are still highly uncertain So an established company
funds a philanthropic initiative that helps SME owners to develop
their business knowledge and capabilities This initiative not only
improves the company s access to potential customers but overtime also
allows it to develop and gauge market opportunities for its commercial
products The company can choose to enter the market itself if and when
it is determined financially viable or it may choose not to in which
case it has protected its downside financial risk all the while
contributing to improving socio economic conditions In practice
calculating real options values requires sophisticated numerical
techniques and should be undertaken with business units in the firm to
ensure consistent assumptions are used Nevertheless its intuition can
be illustrated by adding some numbers to this stylized example Assume
a company s cost of capital is 10 Start up costs in a newmarket are 60
million while market size maybe drawn from three equally likely
scenarios annual revenue streams of 3 million 6 million or 12 million
Using the cash flow based approach the expected i e probability
weighted average discounted value of these perpetual revenue streams
is 70 million Therefore the net present value subtracting start up
costs is 10 million However suppose the company is able to narrow this
uncertainty after engaging in those philanthropic initiatives The
company would decide togo ahead only if it knew that the market
presented the highest revenue scenario where the company would likely
earn 120 million 60 million 60 million The discounted probability
weighted average profits would be 1 10 x 1 3 x 60 million 18 million
since one would not proceed in the other two cases Only the real
options approach allows a company the flexibility to wait and see if
commercialization is viable This flexibility can protect downside risk
and is financially most valuable to the company when 1 There is
greater uncertainty about the size of the market 2 There is
substantial investment needed for infrastructure 3 There are
significant barriers to entry for competitors Even when a leading
company cannot keep competitors completely at bay unlike with a patent
protected by law it can still reap a disproportionate share of
benefits by being the first to build a superior reputation and
relationships in the newmarket 

### Summary 

CGOs can make a more persuasive business case by articulating
clearly the strategies by which they expect philanthropic initiatives
to contribute towards strategic business needs such as improved
employee engagement customer loyalty reputation al risk and growth
opportunities These pathways are often not straightforward To realize
meaningful benefits philanthropic involvement cannot be treated as
just another check in the box Companies must understand the mechanisms
by which they expect these business benefits to be achieved Related
business disciplines have developed a body of evidence and measurement
approaches that can be applied When benefits to the business are long
term or intangible modeling approaches for valuing future cash flows
analyzing scenarios and calibrating expected monetary profits linked
to the behaviors of loyal customers and engaged employees can be used
to estimate financial value as well as to clarify assumptions
Intermediate metrics can help programs deliver those business benefits
by enabling managers to make mid course adjustments as necessary
Companies who find natural innovative opportunities to commit abroad
array of company product expertise and capabilities beyond cash grants
can multiply the business and social returns that their philanthropic
initiatives achieve These opportunities are more likely to arise when
companies establish meaningful long term relationships with nonprofit
partners aligned with the company s priority areas When corporate
donations are disbursed without strategy the benefits will be greatly
limited Heike Bruch and Frank Walter 2005 When corporate from the
University of St Gallen in donations are disbursed Switzerland
distinguish companies as being without strategy the market or
competence oriented in their benefits will be greatly philanthropic
focus Endeavoring to live up limited to stake holder expectations
these market oriented companies are likely to care most about
measuring competitive advantages such as improved marketing
capabilities and better stake holder relationships By contrast
competence oriented companies focus on internal skills when deciding
on the nature of their charitable involvement and for such companies
measuring value from employee engagement and business innovation is
more important than for market oriented companies.
The best approach would seem to be a balanced combination of an
external market and internal competence orientation which would be
more likely to maximize business and social benefits concurrently 13
This review focused on studies that concentrated on companies social
and community behavior which for many companies begins with corporate
philanthropy the charitable donation of dollars products services and
employee volunteer time Some of these studies also considered a
company s broader corporate citizenship performance beyond social and
community engagement and included other aspects of corporate social
responsibility CSR such as governance structure and environmental
impact 14 Known in the psychology literature as the motivation
crowding theory See FreyJegen (2001) and Weibel, Rost, Osterloh (2007).
A recurring statistical criticism of such empirical studies is How
can one disentangle the possibility that companies for whom employees
enjoy working might simply be financially valuable in the first place
Researchers attempt to mitigate this problem by including in their
regression models a slew of control variables such as measures of past
financial performance More rigorous statistical tests require
controlled experiments and field studies that are more complex to
undertake 16 Hills Mahmud 2007 17 See http www pfizer com
responsibility global health global health fellows jsp 18 One can turn
to the HR measurement field for calculation and estimation approaches
to convert outcomes from an HR program to monetary values although no
standard approach exists For example Phillips 2005 provides a review
of HR measurement strategies and describes pp 182 183 how a large
financial institution RB S developed and used an employee engagement
model to link HR information to key business indicators enabling the
business to measure the impact of HR initiatives on business profits
19 In a survey of HR managers and corporate executives who sponsor
executive education programs Charlton Osterweil 2005 found that
while respondents agreed that measuring ROI was important people may
mean different things when they talk about ROI The researchers
conclude that sponsors may not be as wedded to proof of financial ROI
as many HR professionals assume 20 Reichheld Sasser 1990 21 Reich
held 2003 22 Luo Bhatt acharya 2006 and Lev Petrov its Radhakrishnan
2009 23 Conjoint analysis is a statistical technique that originated
in mathematical psychology and is applied to marketing and survey
analyses See Green Srinivasa n 1990 The technique uses statistical de
compositional methods to quantify consumers relative preferences given
their overall evaluations of a set of alternatives which in turn are
specified as levels of different attributes 24 Christi a ens 2008 25
Eccles New qui st Schatz 2007 26 To illustrate the potential role of
philanthropic programs this hypothetical example was adapted from the
field of international business management For example Li Rug man 2007
investigated how to apply real options analysis to foreign direct
investment decisions made by multinational enterprises The focus of
their paper was on only traditional market entry modes such as exports
licensing and wholly owned subsidiaries 

# CONVERSATION THREE. Between the Chief Executive Officer CEO and
investor community.

The investor community tends to pose two
contrasting questions about corporate giving On the one hand
shareholders want assurance that philanthropy adds to or atleast does
not detract from shareholder value On the other hand a growing number
of investors place increasing emphasis on the demonstration of
corporate responsibility A large body of literature already exists
seeking to demonstrate the business value of corporate philanthropy to
both groups Merely for ease of distinction here we will distinguish
these two investor groups as traditional and responsible 

## Question 4. How to measure the value of corporate philanthropy 
for traditional investors.

Scholars have long searched for a link between corporate
philanthropy and premiums in company profits or stock prices They
believe that if this link can be proven statistically it could offer
definitive financial justification for companies to behave as good
corporate citizens Textbook accounting frameworks reveal that a
company s share price multiple the premium that a company s share
price may be worth over its book value of identifiable company assets
can be driven higher through two financial levers 27 1 a lower cost of
capital or 2 higher expectations of how much future profitability
exceeds the company s cost of capital The share price premium that a
company enjoys over its cost of identifiable financial and physical
assets is attributed to intangibles which can comprise a significant
portion of a company s intrinsic value 28 Empirical evidence on share
price valuations and profitability Baruch Lev and Christine Petrov its
at New York University and Sure sh Radhakrishnan 2009 at the
University of Texas collected a large data set of charitable
contributions made by public companies from 1989 through 2000 They
applied a statistical methodology known as Granger causality which
distinguishes causation from association and found that charitable
contributions increased the subsequent revenue growth of their donors
This causal relationship was found only in industries highly sensitive
to consumer perception and for these consumer oriented companies
within their sample period a basic calculation suggests that giving
500 000 caused net profits to rise by almost 800 000 The researchers
could not detect a relationship between charitable giving and profits
nor sales growth in non consumer industries such as industrial
companies A study by Ray F is man and Geoffrey Heal of Columbia
Business School and V in ayN air 2007 of the Wharton School used a
different data set to explore similar hypotheses They collected
financial data from 1991 to 2003 to calculate profitability and price
to book ratios for individual companies and also collected information
about average advertising intensity for different industries
Philanthropy ratings came from the SOCRATES database maintained by KL
D Research and Analytics Similarly to Le ve tal these researchers
found a positive statistical relationship between philanthropy and
company financial performance as measured by profitability and price
to book ratios only in advertising intensive industries such as
consumer oriented companies However the economic magnitude detected
was not large Joshua M argolis Hillary Elf en be in and James Walsh
2007 from Harvard Business School University of California and
University of Michigan respectively conducted a review of 167 similar
scholarly studies They concluded that after thirty five years of
research the preponderance of scholarly evidence suggests a mildly
positive relationship between corporate social performance and
corporate financial performance and finds no indication that corporate
social investments systematically decrease shareholder value 29 More
critically they and other
researchers have acknowledged a the preponderance of number of
weaknesses in the methodologies scholarly evidence and data comprising
these studies Even suggests a mildly positive when such economic links
exist flaws such relationship between as these would reduce the power
of corporate social statistical tests to prove them performance and 1
There is wide variation in how corporate financial companies are
assessed on their performance and finds no corporate social
performance Many indication that corporate studies use observer
perceptions or social investments insiders self reported impressions
that systematically decrease may suffer from biases e g the halo
shareholder value effect Others use third party audits that are often
not transparent or open to validation Simple metrics like contribution
amounts do not reflect how effectively donation dollars are actually
spent 2 Much of the business value of corporate philanthropy can be
classified as contributing to the intangibles of a company which may
only show up in profits several years later and many studies do not
examine the impact on profits over a sufficiently long timeframe There
is also mixed evidence on how efficiently stock markets price
companies whose intangibles makeup a large proportion of their value 3
Some studies measure financial performance as positive market adjusted
stock price returns These results can be sensitive to the sample
period chosen Ideally a study would observe along period that
effectively smoothes out the high variability in stock price movement
and spans full economic cycles Even more critically care must betaken
when interpreting the hypotheses supported by such tests If
philanthropic companies are successful in attracting more investors
and raising capital at a lower cost one would expect the stock price
multiples of these companies to be higher and average stock returns
lower than for less philanthropic companies When stocks are priced
efficiently the lower cost of capital required by investors in
philanthropic companies should match the lower average returns they
subsequently earn overtime as a result of holding those stocks
Research by Harrison Hong and Marcin Kac per c zyk 2007 from Princeton
University and the University of British Columbia Traditional
investors respectively illustrates such a relationship with tobacco
companies To date the tobacco industry represents the most prevalent
negative screen applied by socially responsible investors Over the
past three and a half decades tobacco stocks consistent with losing
access to capital from a class of investors 30 have been priced at
lower multiples their price to book multiples were 15 lower than non
tobacco stocks At the sametime consistent with having to deliver a
higher return on capital average stock returns from these s in stocks
outperformed other comparable stocks by approximately 2 4 a year 4
Many studies are in explicit about the direction of causality Can
companies afford to be more philanthropic because they have performed
better financially rather than the other way around Studies also must
control for other company characteristics that drive financial
performance but maybe correlated to philanthropic spending such as
industry risk size research and development and advertising
expenditures 5 Across companies the relationship between corporate
philanthropy and financial performance is quite complex Researchers 31
have found the relationship to be nonlinear and show decreasing
returns to scale after all corporate philanthropy cannot be expected
to increase financial performance in perpetuity The relationship has
also been found to be weaker among companies and industries that are
less advertising or innovation focused Summary M argolis Elf en be in
and Walsh concluded that research must reach beyond simply assessing
the magnitude of the corporate social and financial performance
relationship it must now show how corporate social performance comes
to bear upon corporate financial performance Put another way It is
time to study mechanisms more systematically Addressing the hypotheses
posed in both these scholarly studies and by traditional investors
requires measuring and understanding the operational drivers of
business value business value derived from increased employee
engagement customer loyalty reputation al capital and opportunities
for innovation 

## Question 5. How to attract responsible investors.

A company's cost of capital is
the price it pays investors to supply capital for its business
activities It is the rate of return that investors require for
investing in a company If a company attracts a larger pool of
potential investors it can raise capital at a lower cost than its
peers earn a wider profit margin and enjoy a higher stock price
multiple Effect on cost of capital and share prices Socially
responsible investing SRI the practice of investors who think
ethically and socially about which stocks to buy sell or avoid
altogether has along history In its earlier forms SRI was regarded as
a niche investment style In the first wave of SRI strategies investors
applied negative screening and excluded entire sectors or groups of
stocks based on a set of ethical criteria The next wave of strategies
using positive screening was introduced by benchmark providers such as
the Dow Jones Sustainability Index DJS I This selected only the
companies that rated highest on a broader set of environmental social
and governance ES G responsibility criteria The total amount of money
invested in traditional SRI is still considered to be relatively small
and volatile In the 2008 Report on Socially Responsible Investing
Trends in the United States The Social Investment Forum estimated that
approximately one in every ten dollars of assets under institutional
management in the U S an estimated 2 3 trillion out of 24 trillion was
invested in companies that rate high on some measure of social
responsibility Analysts generally estimate that SRI presently makes up
no more than 5 10 of all stock market investments A far more important
factor will depend on how much mainstream investors start to recognize
and reward performance incorporate social responsibility CSR
Increasingly investors are recognizing that responsible corporate
performance when combined with traditional financial analysis in forms
their assessments about whether companies are good financial
investments This also removes the issue of personal values based
preferences which can be a slippery slope to navigate particularly for
professional money managers European institutional investors appear to
be leading and adopting this movement more widely For example Swedish
and Norwegian pension funds representing close to 1 trillion of
combined assets recently signed on to the
Sustainable Value Increasingly investors are Creation Initiative S VC
to influence recognizing that companies to improve the social and
responsible corporate environmental aspects of their operations
performance when which they believe reduce risks and costs combined
with traditional while harnessing and developing business financial
analysis in forms opportunities 32 their assessments Researchers from
the University of about whether companies British Columbia and the
University of are good financial Vienna 33 created a model of stock
market investments prices to examine how social investors materially
affect those prices This model determined whether a growing class of
socially concerned investors would create incentives for companies to
act in a more socially responsible manner by lowering their cost of
capital In their book Investing for Change August in Landi er and Vi
nay Nair have applied this model to estimate a back of the envelope
relationship between stock price valuation and the proportion of
socially responsible investors in the market For example if the amount
of SRI capital switches from 10 of the total available capital to 15
in three years the cost of capital of responsible companies maybe
lowered by more than 0 8 Such a drop from say a 10 0 return required
by investors to 9 2 could increase the valuation of these companies by
as much as 11 34 Other researchers have approached this question by
examining how substantially stock prices have moved based on SRI
motivated capital flows SRI funds often track membership in certain
specialized benchmarks to identify which companies to invest in These
benchmarks are maintained by index providers such as Dow Jones or FTSE
often in collaboration with ES G research firms As companies are
included or dropped from such indexes one would expect SRI linked
capital to flow into or out of those stocks These are potentially
abrupt events if SRI flows are material enough they could drive stock
prices of companies entering indexes to rise atleast temporarily and
those exiting to experience a drop Researchers have collected large
datasets of these events and examined the average stock price changes
accounting for broader market movements and other factors typically
controlled for in event study methodologies. In recent working papers
from the Federal Reserve 
Bank of Atlanta and Bank of Finland 35 researchers looked at the price
performance of all stocks between 1990 and 2004 on the announcement
that they were dropped from the Domini 400 Social Index They found
that the exiting company experienced a significant abnormal stock
price drop of about 3 Another research team 36 at the University of
Calgary studied additions and deletions of North American stocks to
the Dow Jones Sustainability Index from 2002 to 2007 They found that
inclusion in this index was valuable for a company measuring a boost
in market value of about 2 compared to stocks that were dropped
Mainstream responsible investing Contrary to earlier and more
traditional approaches of SRI which was driven largely by investors
personal values the case for mainstream institutional investors lies
in recognizing that responsible corporate behavior is a proxy for the
quality of company management and the extent to which that management
is forward looking and adaptable Responsible investing RI is
characterized by the incorporation of social and environmental factors
within traditional investment decision making processes based on the
rationale that such a combined investment framework is more effective
for assessing the financial value of companies particularly over the
long term The growth and influence of responsible investing will be
determined more by the interest of mainstream investors than by
traditional SRI funds In April 2006 former UN Secretary General Kofi
Annan launched a global initiative centered on a set of voluntary
values and guidelines for asset owners and professionals The PRI
Report on Progress 2008 reported that as of May 2008 approximately 300
financial institutions representing a total of 15 trillion in
professionally managed assets have subscribed to these UN Principles
for Responsible Investment The six principles listed below are not
prescriptive but they provide a framework according to which investors
can organize and integrate ES G criteria into mainstream investment
analysis and ownership practices Although subscription to these
principles does not necessarily mean that all funds already fully
comply with them funds are nevertheless expected to pursue compliance
and to report to the UN Secretariat on their progress.
The Six UN Principles for Responsible Investment are 1 We
will incorporate ES G issues into investment analysis and decision
making processes 2 We will be active owners and incorporate ES G
issues into our ownership policies and practices 3 We will seek
appropriate disclosure onE SG issues from the entities in which we
invest 4 We will promote acceptance and implementation of the
Principles within the investment industry 5 We will work together to
enhance our effectiveness in implementing the Principles 6 We will
each report on our activities and progress towards implementing the
Principles The potential impact of responsible investing on how stocks
are revalued and corporations behave is huge If just a third of
subscribers implement these principles in their investment process the
combined size of investments linked to some corporate responsibility
criteria would triple However the range of screening criteria and
rating assessments is wide in contrast to simple early SRI approaches
like tobacco industry screens Professional managers and analysts cite
a general view broadly consistent with recognizing ES G performance as
a proxy for management quality insofar as it reflects the company s
ability to respond to long term trends and maintaining a competitive
advantage 37 Much of their specific analysis ultimately relies on the
subjective judgment of individual analysts and on proprietary
frameworks rather than standardized metrics A review of the ratings
processes of major ES G research firms confirms that while their
general principles share much overlap they do apply subjective metrics
and proprietary rating schemes These ratings generally consider not
only the level of philanthropic contributions but also attempt to
account for other factors such as the innovative quality of giving and
the measurement processes involved In 1999 Dow Jones Company launched
the first global indexes tracking the stock price performance of
leading sustainability driven companies worldwide According to the Dow
Jones Sustainable Indexes 2007 Annual Review asset managers in sixteen
countries collectively managed about 6 billion based on the DJSI. 
Inclusion within the index is
based on criteria that are weighted approximately equally for economic
environmental and social performance though actual weights differ
among industry groups In order to apply for inclusion in the DJS I
companies must complete a questionnaire an extensive survey that
incorporates both generic as well as industry specific questions This
information is supplemented by company and third party documents
personal contact between analysts and company representatives and
additional information from media and NGOs Companies are ranked within
their industry groups and selected for the indexes if they are among
the top 10 of sustainability leaders in the irrespective industry
sectors Although a significant commitment of costs and efforts maybe
required for collecting the information and completing the survey
companies see the DJS I label as an important mechanism for
establishing a reputation in sustainability The general section of the
survey questionnaire is comprised of 51 sets of questions covering
economic environmental and social issues Accounting for 3 5 weight in
the company s overall score corporate philanthropy is assessed based
in part on responses to these questions 38 1 Does the company have a
system in place to measure the business social and reputation stake

conform to those guidelines nor verifies their accuracy thus
potentially reducing the reports value to investors Moreover the

includes performance indicators that fall into one of the following
categories economic 9 indicators environmental 30 labor practice 14

The G 3 indicator for community impact SO 1 obliges companies to
report the nature scope and effectiveness of any programs and
practices that assess and manage the impact of operations on
communities including entering operating and exiting In a review of 72
company reports the GRI found that the majority of G-3 reporters claim
to be reporting in accordance with the G-3 Guidelines SO-1 indicator
however in reality only 11 of the G-3 reporters fully report according
to the SO-1 indicator
protocol 42 The reports examined were found to focus mostly on
reporting their own performance as opposed to what changes or benefits
occur as a result of their activities and to emphasize positive
community impact without mentioning any negative ones Summary A high
quality measurement process is If the criteria applied by social
rating firms a critical input for good seem inconsistent and
subjective this may management and be as much a result of the
unevenness and demonstrates that a ambiguity of what many companies
company recognizes how disclose It is also unclear to what extent its
philanthropic strategies criteria and disclosures are linked to can be
successful in financial value There is a significant creating long
term opportunity for companies to lead the business value industry in
developing standards or differentiating themselves to the investor
community through their disclosures about philanthropic efforts
Documentation of the measurement process should bean important part of
establishing quality disclosures and standards A high quality
measurement process is a critical input for good management and
demonstrates that a company recognize show its philanthropic
strategies can be successful in creating long term business value The
Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes questionnaire also asks if the
company has in place a measurement system although it does not provide
guidance about what Dow Jones considers to be a good system The review
and findings summarized in this report suggest that companies could
berated on at least the following criteria 1 The company has
documented high quality logic models or understanding of the process
by which its various types of philanthropic initiatives achieve
business benefits 2 The company has defined business related outcome
metrics measures them and has in place a rigorous process to improve
or re align its various philanthropic strategies 3 The company
systematically tracks social outcomes and compares these to targets or
benchmarks by which it can monitor whether its philanthropic
investments are effective overall. A

# Conclusion 

Philanthropic initiatives provide novel channels through
which companies can meet core business goals and create long term
financial value by increasing employee engagement customer loyalty
reputation al capital and market opportunities These improvements are
most effective when corporate giving teams work in concert with
existing company operations However some companies do not target or
measure the business benefits of their philanthropy possibly because
these benefits are intangible or not easily associated with short term
financial profits Measurement frameworks can be introduced by
leveraging models and evidence developed by related business
disciplines they can also help identify key intermediate outcomes that
if targeted can ultimately yield desired business behaviors and
benefits Scholarly studies have found that these links are not always
straightforward however It is hoped that the analysis in this report
will spark additional research measurement and understanding of these
mechanisms For example it will be instructive to study how companies
test and validate the effects of volunteer programs and other
philanthropic activities on employee engagement and behavior It will
also be useful to learn from companies experiences with estimating
cash flows probabilities discount rates and other model parameters
that affect the valuation of growth opportunities arising from
philanthropic projects Many companies already possess related data and
valuable examples There is much room for those companies to conduct
and share thoughtful analyses of methodologies and frameworks without
disclosing proprietary business information This work is not merely
academic it provides actionable research based evidence in support of
measuring value and promoting more effective alignment of
philanthropic programs with core business goals A wide range of social
impact assessment frameworks is available in the social sector many of
these frameworks have been put forth by sophisticated private
foundations reflecting their unique needs and goals Given the
diversity of missions that nonprofit organizations and f under s
pursue there appears to be no single quantitative or qualitative
methodology against which performance of all grant types can be
evaluated Which approach a corporate giver should apply will depend on
the motivation and focus of its philanthropic program.

For example, the appropriate measurement strategy will depend on
whether a company seeks to meet communal obligations build a signature
partnership make a few high value grants to one cause make many one
off grants addressing multiple causes or a combination of these
Nonprofit organizations face mounting Measurement is not an pressure
to demonstrate the effectiveness of unnecessary burden or their
programs Because they can call on un recoverable cost if it internal
relevant skills and experiences adds value companies are in an apt
position to help grant ees emphasize and take advantage of measurement
both to communicate and improve performance Measurement is not an
unnecessary burden or un recoverable cost if it adds value Its value
is maximized by organizations that harness it to build and learn from
data over time In a challenging economic period when organizations
seek to reduce overhead expenses of any kind it is particularly
important to distinguish good from bad overhead and to maintain
funding dedicated to the ongoing improvement of philanthropic bang for
the buck The investor community increasingly esteems companies with
strong community records Investors reason that such behavior
represents the quality and foresight of management Investors and
analysts appreciate disclosures about philanthropic commitments that
are comparable material and financially relevant Absent effective
industry standards companies have an opportunity to distinguish
themselves in their conversations with the investor community by
proposing standards of their own Part of such a proposal may include
detailed insights into the related measurement process which can help
demonstrate understanding of what drives long term business success
quality of management and superior potential to create financial value
The value of corporate philanthropy is measurable as with many
elements of business however it cannot always be measured as precisely
as we would like 43 What gets measured gets managed goes the old adage
indeed measurement plays a crucial role in enabling companies to reach
their full potential both philanthropically and as more successful and
sustainable enterprises overall.
