    "We introduce large language models (LLMs) through a financial natural language processing (NLP) task: summarizing the *Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk* sections of 10-K reports. To assess performance, we compare the overlap and readability of summaries generated by GPT-4o-mini, a proprietary closed-source model, and DeepSeek-R1-14B, an open-source model that can be downloaded and run locally. Small language models, particularly those trained using techniques like **distillation**, can closely approximate the performance of larger models while offering lower latency and reduced memory requirements."

      "sensitivities. It seems like it's part of their financial disclosures, maybe in\n",
      "their annual report or something similar. Let me break down what each section is\n",
      "saying.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the foreign exchange risk. They have a significant amount of revenue from\n",
      "Brazil, Argentina, and other Latin American countries. Since they're dealing\n",
      "with multiple currencies, especially the Brazilian real and Argentine peso,\n",
      "which can be volatile, this could affect their financials. If the real or peso\n",
      "weakens against the dollar, their reported revenue in dollars might decrease\n",
      "because when converted, those currencies would buy fewer dollars. That makes\n",
      "sense because if you have a lot of revenue in a currency that's dropping, your\n",
      "overall revenue in USD terms goes down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next is interest rate risk. They have long-term debt, which means they're\n",
      "exposed to changes in interest rates. If rates go up, the value of their\n",
      "existing debt might decrease, and their borrowing costs could increase if they\n",
      "need to refinance or take on more debt. I'm not entirely sure how sensitive they\n",
      "are to rate changes, but it's something to watch, especially with global\n",
      "interest rates potentially rising.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there's commodity price risk. They're exposed to fuel and electricity\n",
      "prices because these are operational costs. If oil prices go up, their delivery\n",
      "and logistics costs would increase, affecting their margins. Similarly, higher\n",
      "electricity prices could impact their operations, especially in countries where\n",
      "energy is a significant cost. This seems like a manageable risk but could have\n",
      "noticeable effects if prices spike.\n",
      "\n",
      "Equity price risk is tied to their LTRP plans. These are long-term retention\n",
      "programs that pay out based on stock performance. The value of these obligations\n",
      "is sensitive to the company's stock price. If the stock goes up, the payouts\n",
      "increase, which could strain their finances. Conversely, a drop in stock price\n",
      "reduces the payout liability. They've done a sensitivity analysis showing how a\n",
      "40% change in stock price affects the obligation. That's pretty significant; a\n",
      "40% drop would reduce the liability from $418 million to about $251 million,\n",
      "which is a substantial difference.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inflation risk is another factor, especially in countries like Argentina where\n",
      "inflation has been high. High inflation can erode purchasing power and affect\n",
      "consumer behavior. If people have less money due to inflation, they might spend\n",
      "less online, impacting MercadoLibre's sales. Additionally, rising costs for\n",
      "goods and services could squeeze margins if the company can't pass these costs\n",
      "onto customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm a bit confused about how exactly the equity price affects their obligations.\n",
      "It seems like it's based on the stock price relative to a fixed average from\n",
      "previous years. So each payment is tied to whether the current stock price is\n",
      "higher or lower than that average. If the stock does well, they have to pay\n",
      "more; if not, less.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm also thinking about how these risks interact. For example, inflation could\n",
      "lead to higher interest rates, which would then affect their debt costs. Or a\n",
      "weaker currency might make imports more expensive, contributing to inflation.\n",
      "It's like a web of interconnected risks that could amplify each other in certain\n",
      "economic conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another point is the sensitivity analysis for equity price risk. They show a\n",
      "static present value and how it changes with different stock prices. This helps\n",
      "investors understand how exposed they are to stock price fluctuations. A 40%\n",
      "change seems extreme, but it's useful to see the range of possible outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wonder if there are any mitigating factors or strategies MercadoLibre uses to\n",
      "manage these risks. For example, do they hedge their currency exposure? How\n",
      "flexible are their costs in the face of inflation? And how do they structure\n",
      "their LTRP plans to balance retention with financial risk?\n",
      "\n",

      "risks into two main parts: foreign currency risk and investment risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Foreign Currency Risk:**\n",
      "   - Imagine you have money in one country's currency, like euros from France or\n",
      "pounds from England. If the value of your home currency (like the US dollar)\n",
      "changes, it can affect how much money you actually have when you exchange it.\n",
      "   - Airbnb deals with over 40 currencies, which means they are exposed to\n",
      "changes in exchange rates. For example, if the US dollar becomes stronger, the\n",
      "money they make from other countries might decrease because those dollars are\n",
      "worth less.\n",
      "   - To protect against these changes, Airbnb uses something called foreign\n",
      "currency derivatives, which are like insurance policies to reduce the impact of\n",
      "bad exchange rate changes. However, even with this protection, there's still\n",
      "some risk. If exchange rates were to change unfavorably, they could lose about\n",
      "$20 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Investment Risk:**\n",
      "   - Airbnb keeps a lot of money in safe investments, like short-term debt\n",
      "securities and government bonds. These are similar to putting money in a savings\n",
      "account where it's secure but doesn't earn a lot.\n",
      "   - If interest rates change, the value of these investments can go up or down.\n",
      "For instance, if interest rates were to increase by 1%, their investment\n",
      "portfolio could decrease by about $20 million.\n",
      "   - However, since most of their investments are short-term, they aren't too\n",
      "affected by small changes in interest rates. It's like having money in a piggy\n",
      "bank where you don't need it right away, so minor fluctuations won't hurt much.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, Airbnb manages risks from exchanging currencies and investing by\n",

      "<think>\n",
      "Okay, so I'm trying to understand this document about MercadoLibre's risks and\n",
      "sensitivities. It seems like it's part of their financial disclosures, maybe in\n",
      "their annual report or something similar. Let me break down what each section is\n",
      "saying.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the foreign exchange risk. They have a significant amount of revenue from\n",
      "Brazil, Argentina, and other Latin American countries. Since they're dealing\n",
      "with multiple currencies, especially the Brazilian real and Argentine peso,\n",
      "which can be volatile, this could affect their financials. If the real or peso\n",
      "weakens against the dollar, their reported revenue in dollars might decrease\n",
      "because when converted, those currencies would buy fewer dollars. That makes\n",
      "sense because if you have a lot of revenue in a currency that's dropping, your\n",
      "overall revenue in USD terms goes down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next is interest rate risk. They have long-term debt, which means they're\n",
      "exposed to changes in interest rates. If rates go up, the value of their\n",
      "existing debt might decrease, and their borrowing costs could increase if they\n",
      "need to refinance or take on more debt. I'm not entirely sure how sensitive they\n",
      "are to rate changes, but it's something to watch, especially with global\n",
      "interest rates potentially rising.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there's commodity price risk. They're exposed to fuel and electricity\n",
      "prices because these are operational costs. If oil prices go up, their delivery\n",
      "and logistics costs would increase, affecting their margins. Similarly, higher\n",
      "electricity prices could impact their operations, especially in countries where\n",
      "energy is a significant cost. This seems like a manageable risk but could have\n",
      "noticeable effects if prices spike.\n",
      "\n",
      "Equity price risk is tied to their LTRP plans. These are long-term retention\n",
      "programs that pay out based on stock performance. The value of these obligations\n",
      "is sensitive to the company's stock price. If the stock goes up, the payouts\n",
      "increase, which could strain their finances. Conversely, a drop in stock price\n",
      "reduces the payout liability. They've done a sensitivity analysis showing how a\n",
      "40% change in stock price affects the obligation. That's pretty significant; a\n",
      "40% drop would reduce the liability from $418 million to about $251 million,\n",
      "which is a substantial difference.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inflation risk is another factor, especially in countries like Argentina where\n",
      "inflation has been high. High inflation can erode purchasing power and affect\n",
      "consumer behavior. If people have less money due to inflation, they might spend\n",
      "less online, impacting MercadoLibre's sales. Additionally, rising costs for\n",
      "goods and services could squeeze margins if the company can't pass these costs\n",
      "onto customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm a bit confused about how exactly the equity price affects their obligations.\n",
      "It seems like it's based on the stock price relative to a fixed average from\n",
      "previous years. So each payment is tied to whether the current stock price is\n",
      "higher or lower than that average. If the stock does well, they have to pay\n",
      "more; if not, less.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm also thinking about how these risks interact. For example, inflation could\n",
      "lead to higher interest rates, which would then affect their debt costs. Or a\n",
      "weaker currency might make imports more expensive, contributing to inflation.\n",
      "It's like a web of interconnected risks that could amplify each other in certain\n",
      "economic conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another point is the sensitivity analysis for equity price risk. They show a\n",
      "static present value and how it changes with different stock prices. This helps\n",
      "investors understand how exposed they are to stock price fluctuations. A 40%\n",
      "change seems extreme, but it's useful to see the range of possible outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wonder if there are any mitigating factors or strategies MercadoLibre uses to\n",
      "manage these risks. For example, do they hedge their currency exposure? How\n",
      "flexible are their costs in the face of inflation? And how do they structure\n",
      "their LTRP plans to balance retention with financial risk?\n",
      "\n",

      "Both have an opinion section, a basis for opinion, and some additional details.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with the opinion on internal control over financial reporting. The\n",
      "auditors state that they've audited AT&T's internal controls as of December 31,\n",
      "2023, based on the COSO criteria. They conclude that the company maintained\n",
      "effective internal control over financial reporting in all material respects.\n",
      "That sounds positive; it means the auditors think AT&T has good systems in place\n",
      "to manage their finances properly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, looking at the basis for this opinion. It mentions that management is\n",
      "responsible for maintaining these controls and assessing their effectiveness.\n",
      "The auditors' role was to express an opinion based on their audit, which they\n",
      "did by following PCAOB standards. They obtained an understanding of the internal\n",
      "controls, assessed risks, tested the design and operation of the controls, and\n",
      "performed other necessary procedures. Their conclusion is that AT&T's controls\n",
      "are effective.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving on to the report on the consolidated financial statements. The auditors\n",
      "also express an unqualified opinion here, meaning they didn't find any material\n",
      "issues with the financial statements. They were prepared in accordance with\n",
      "GAAP, which is standard for public companies in the U.S.\n",

      "The basis for this opinion section explains that the auditors are responsible\n",
      "for expressing opinions on whether the financial statements present fairly, in\n",
      "all material respects, the company's financial position and results of\n",
      "operations. They did this by auditing according to PCAOB standards, assessing\n",
      "risks, testing accounting policies, significant estimates, transactions, and\n",
      "disclosures.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are also two specific sections discussing areas where the audit was\n",
      "particularly complex: internal control over financial reporting and the\n",
      "impairment evaluations for certain reporting units. The auditors explain that\n",
      "these areas required a deeper dive because they involve subjective assumptions\n",
      "and complex methodologies. They tested controls, assessed assumptions against\n",
      "industry trends, performed sensitivity analyses, and involved specialists to\n",

      "\n",
      "The report ends with a note that the auditing firm has been serving AT&T since\n",

      "I'm trying to think if there's anything I might be missing. The document seems\n",
      "comprehensive, covering both the internal controls and financial statements. It\n",
      "mentions specific areas like impairment evaluations and valuation models, which\n",

      "### Key Findings:\n",
      "1. **Internal Control Over Financial Reporting:**\n",
      "   - The auditors found that AT&T maintained effective internal controls as of\n",
      "December 31, 2023, based on the COSO framework.\n",
      "   - The company's systems provide reasonable assurance regarding the\n",

      "2. **Consolidated Financial Statements:**\n",
      "   - The financial statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP and present\n",
      "AT&T's financial position accurately.\n",
      "   - No material issues were identified, leading to an unqualified opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Methodology:\n",
      "- Auditors followed PCAOB standards, assessing risks, testing controls, and\n",
      "involving specialists for complex areas like impairment evaluations.\n",
      "- Detailed procedures included testing assumptions against industry trends and\n",
      "performing sensitivity analyses.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas of Complexity:\n",
      "- **Impairment Evaluations:** Involved subjective assumptions and complex\n",

      "testing and specialist involvement.\n",
      "- **Internal Controls:** The effectiveness was validated through a comprehensive\n",

      "Okay, so I need to summarize this risk report for fifth graders. Let me read\n",
      "through it carefully first.\n",
      "\n",
      "The report talks about market risks the company faces, specifically interest\n",
      "rate risk, fuel price risk, and commodities price risk. Hmm, I should break each\n",
      "section down into simpler terms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with interest rate risk: The company has both fixed and variable debt.\n",
      "Fixed rates don't change, while variable ones do based on market rates. They use\n",
      "swaps to manage this risk. If rates go up or down by 100 basis points, their\n",
      "interest expense changes by about $20 million. I should explain what a swap is\n",
      "in simple terms, maybe like an agreement to balance out the risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, fuel price risk: Fuel costs are a big part of their expenses. They try to\n",
      "hedge against price changes but currently have no hedges in place. A 20-cent\n",
      "change per gallon affects both their costs and what they charge customers.\n",
      "Petrochemical products used in operations also cost money, so higher prices\n",
      "there would increase their costs too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, commodities price risk: They sell recycled materials, and market\n",
      "fluctuations affect their revenue. Previously, they used derivatives like swaps\n",
      "to hedge this, but none are active now. A $10 per ton change affects both\n",
      "revenue and operating income by about $10 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "I need to make sure I explain terms like \"hedging\" in a way fifth graders can\n",
      "understand, maybe as strategies to protect against price changes. Also, I should\n",
      "avoid jargon and keep sentences short and clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me structure the summary with each risk as a separate point, using simple\n",

      "\n",
      "The company faces several risks related to market changes that could impact its\n",
      "financial health. Here's a breakdown of these risks explained in a way fifth\n",
      "graders can understand:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Interest Rate Risk:**\n",
      "   - The company borrows money through loans with both fixed and variable\n",
      "interest rates.\n",
      "   - Fixed rates stay the same, while variable rates change based on market\n",
      "conditions.\n",
      "   - To manage these changes, they use something called \"swaps,\" which are\n",
      "agreements to balance out potential losses or gains from rate changes.\n",
      "   - If interest rates go up or down by a certain amount (100 basis points),\n",
      "their yearly interest expense would change by about $20 million. This is like\n",
      "how a school might adjust its budget if the cost of supplies goes up or down.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Fuel Price Risk:**\n",
      "   - Fuel costs are a major expense for the company, similar to how a school\n",
      "might spend money on transportation.\n",
      "   - They try to protect against fuel price changes by using strategies called\n",
      "\"hedging,\" but currently, they don't have any such strategies in place.\n",
      "   - A 20-cent change in diesel price per gallon would affect both their costs\n",
      "and what they charge customers. For example, if diesel goes up by 20 cents,\n",
      "their expenses increase, and they might need to charge more to cover this cost.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Commodities Price Risk:**\n",
      "   - The company sells recycled materials like cardboard and newspaper.\n",
      "   - Market changes can cause prices of these materials to go up or down,\n",
      "affecting both revenue and how much money they make.\n",
      "   - They used to use tools like \"swaps\" and \"collars\" to manage these price\n",
      "changes, but currently, they aren't using any such tools.\n",
      "   - A $10 per ton change in recycled material prices would impact their yearly\n",
      "revenue and profits by about $10 million. This is similar to how a lemonade\n",
      "stand might adjust its prices if the cost of lemons fluctuates.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the company deals with risks from changing interest rates, fuel\n",
      "prices, and recycled materials markets. They use strategies like swaps to manage\n",
      "some of these risks but are currently exposed to others. Understanding these\n",
      "risks helps them make better financial decisions, much like how planning for\n",

      "interest rates, currency exchange rates, and commodity prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, for interest-rate risks, the company looks at how changes in interest\n",
      "rates can affect the value of its assets and debts. They estimate what would\n",
      "happen if interest rates suddenly went up by 1%. In 2023, the company faced\n",
      "losses of $29.2 million from cash and marketable securities and $146.5 million\n",
      "from fixed-rate loans. However, they also had gains from fixed-rate debts and\n",
      "interest-rate swaps, leading to a total loss of $17.7 million, which was worse\n",
      "than the previous year’s loss of $1.1 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, the report discusses currency risks. The company uses contracts to protect\n",
      "itself from changes in foreign currency values, especially with currencies like\n",
      "the Canadian dollar and the euro. If the value of these currencies drops by 10%,\n",
      "the company could lose $259.7 million in 2023, compared to $216.6 million in\n",
      "2022. However, these losses would be balanced out by changes in the value of the\n",
      "things they are protecting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, the company also deals with commodity price risks. They use contracts to\n",
      "lock in prices for materials needed to make trucks. If commodity prices drop by\n",
      "10%, they could lose $3.3 million in 2023, up from $2.5 million in 2022. Again,\n",
